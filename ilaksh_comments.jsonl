I can clarify something about the number of ML jobs. 90% of my clients are convinced or nearly convinced that they cannot fulfill their chat agent requirements without fine-tuning a new LLM.<p>I do have at least one job in my profile that involved fine tuning. That may explain why some of the clients hired me. But one thing to note is that I do not claim to be a machine learning engineer because I&#x27;m not. I say I&#x27;m a software engineer with a recent focus on generative AI.<p>0% of the clients actually need to fine-tune an LLM in order to fulfill their requirements. What they need is any LLM close to the state of the art, temperature 0, and a good system prompt. Maybe some function&#x2F;tool calling and RAG.<p>The one guy that I did fine-tuning for, he kept telling me to feed small documents into qLoRA without generating a dataset, just the raw document. I did it over and over and kept showing him it didn&#x27;t work. But it did sort of pick up patterns (not useful knowledge) from larger documents, so he kept telling me to try it with the smaller documents.<p>Eventually, I showed him how perfectly RAG worked for his larger documents like a manual. But he still kept telling me to run the small documents through. It was ridiculous.<p>I also ended up creating a tool to generate QA pairs from raw documents to create a real dataset. Did not get to fully test that because he wasn&#x27;t interested.<p>Anyway, the SOTA LLMs are general purpose. Fine-tuning an LLM would be like phase 3 of a project that is designed to make it faster or cheaper or work 10% better. It is actually hard to make that effort pay off because LLM pricing can be very competitive.<p>Machine learning knowledge is not required for fine-tuning LLMs anyway.

And I think AI is unlocking amazing potential.<p>However, I believe that it is very easy to see how current AI can quickly advance to the point where it is dangerous.<p>Create a whole bunch of agents connected to the internet, motivated by profit. Probably will be amazing. For a year or two or three.<p>But then look at say GPT-5&#x2F;6 or whatever a little ways down the line. Nvidia or other new startups put out amazing new AI accelerators.<p>Now the agents are operating at 10 times human thinking speed, robust cognition, 160 IQ, swarms of them, in a large marketplace, accessing APIs to purchase or control just about anything. For many companies, if you want to compete, you need to have an agent swarm in these markets. And if you try to make them pause for human feedback, they will instantly lose out to the competition that is operating at ten times human decision making speed.<p>Practically speaking, I don&#x27;t think the GPT Store would be the least bit dangerous in it&#x27;s initial form. But at least for me it&#x27;s very easy to project forward. So for people who have made public pledges to keep everything under control, the pace of commercialization and trajectory seemed unsafe.<p>I think the board is operating as it was designed.<p>However, I also think that within a year or two, it won&#x27;t matter as far as AI safety. Because the open models will also be much smarter and faster than the average human. There will be many agent marketplaces controlling real-world systems.<p>My own belief has always been that you need to limit the AI hardware speed and make other physical limitations so people don&#x27;t just get left in the dust and end up handing over control to AI systems by default. They won&#x27;t (necessarily) be alive or anything, but it could be inherently unsafe to have so many autonomous highly intelligent systems controlling everything for us to such a large degree.

Because LLMs don&#x27;t have many streams of high bandwidth sensory data connected to bodies being integrated. If it somehow experienced an emotion in a way, it cannot be similar to how we experience it, because emotions (at least strong ones) are felt in the body.<p>When we feel something like a strong negative emotion, that is driven by a type of intelligence that has to put everything in context and then (reflexively) &quot;decide&quot; to send a signal that we experience somewhat similarly to physical pain.

This is the same regardless of the age of the person.<p>So most of these disruptions do not require some big leap or fresh new perspective.<p>For example, I was around 35 when Docker was really becoming popular. The immediate idea that occurred to me was to build an IaaS business around it. I believe that lots of other people in their 20s or whatever age had the same idea.<p>Because the idea was really just about applying the new technology in a fairly obvious way. Since it was already a disruptive technology, that was enough to be disruptive in that domain it was applied to.<p>So again, I think the vast majority of innovation is in this category. Maybe because those types of innovations are much more accessible than fundamental research.<p>When I saw what ChatGPT could do last year I immediately started trying to figure out how to use it to build a code generation startup. I know that many people who were not 45 like me and instead were in their 30s or just out of college or in college or high school or 50 or 60s or whatever had a very similar idea. I literally saw demos of software that was very similar to my own tests along with articles about how they had just finished college or whatever.<p>I also have seen young people in a particular domain that is obviously being disrupted ignore the disruption. You can be entrenched in something just as easily as a 23 year old. Whereas someone like me who has always been excited about applying new technologies was quite interested in shifting focus onto how the new technology really changed that area. The younger and older people who had been invested in this specific activity and were not by nature primarily into innovation were unaware or at least unexcited about abandoning their existing domain for something that was related but new.<p>It&#x27;s really about mindset and skillset. Someone who has technology skills in certain areas and has made a habit of, for example, picking up new technologies and applying them, is going to be much more likely to do that and keep doing that, than someone who is younger and doesn&#x27;t have those skills and habits. It&#x27;s about an orientation embracing technologically-driven change. That isn&#x27;t determined by age. It&#x27;s a worldview and type of skillset.<p>One other thing that matters is going to be your circumstances. I have a twin brother who has a family and a real job. I have either avoided that or just not managed it, depending on how you interpret things. But at least part of it is my attitude and my identity.<p>As our society ages, I predict that attitudes towards ageism, even in the technology world, will shift towards less tolerance for it.", "time": 1695717834, "type": "comment"}

{"by": "ilaksh", "id": 37550658, "parent": 37545264, "text": "Actually, Fortran and COBOL _did_ replace programmers, as far as I know. It was largely women at the beginning because it was quite tedious and the first computer languages were assembly or machine code. They were so far from the application or mathematical language and often had to be programmed in difficult processes like sometimes literally flipping switches, or input systems that were slow to set up.<p>But then came high level assembly languages and even higher level application languages. And easier to use input systems. Programmer used to literally be the person either translating some finished math into assembly language or actually encoding code into punch cards or both.<p>All of that went away with better tools. So when this article claims that this stuff didn&#x27;t take jobs, they are wrong. It literally did.<p>The other thing the article gets wrong is that people are concerned that ChatGPT and the current generation of LLMs will literally replace software developers today in equivalent fully general capacity. No one thinks that. No one whatsoever.<p>What is obvious, however, is that it is possible to use something like the existing ChatGPT API and models to do certain simple specific programming tasks. That means that _some_ things you might have previously hired a programmer for can now be done automatically.<p>The applications that I have got working are things like creating a chat interface for querying a specific database, where the system generates the SQL and then formats or summarizes the output.  Or creating a web page from a template with just a little bit of custom functionality.<p>So the current version of GPT cannot replace the actual abilities of a programmer, but these AI-powered app or analysis generator are definitely chipping away at the amount of basic but custom tasks that you need to hire a programmer for.<p>The main concept though which the author seems to not get is that these systems will continue to improve year in and year out. And the pace we are on, even assuming it slows down a bit, means that we can expect the complexity of programming tasks that LLMs can handle to continue to improve.<p>There is no reason to believe that it won&#x27;t pretty shortly end up being better than any human. Especially when you can narrow down the task to a specific popular type of application.<p>As soon as I saw ChatGPT last year, I realized that this was eventually going to impact jobs for software development. To what degree and how soon was not determined, but it is obvious it will have a very large impact at some point.<p>So within two days I started working on my own code generation startup leveraging GPT. Within 1-3 years I expect the competition in this area will be very intense. Within five years it will be very obviously competing directly with freelance programmers for small contracts. You will literally see articles like &quot;Use this ChatGPT Plugin instead of spending $10000 on a Freelance Programmer&quot; and it will work.<p>Actually right now I know there is someone who always advertises on HN for building a GPT-powered chatbot for $10000. There are websites that will make the same thing for under $100 per month. At least one that can generate code for custom chatbots. And I am planning to add chatbot capability to my platform which my code generating AI system can easily hook into. So my system will be able to build custom chatbots also within a few months. As a ChatGPT plugin with hosting for $15&#x2F;month. Directly competing with that guy charging $10000.", "time": 1694995352, "type": "comment"}

And it was very fast and completely reliable. Pretty expensive also, but not much compared to the total cost of the project.<p>Then months later a &quot;hardware expert&quot; was brought on and they insisted that the SSD be replaced by a mechanical disk because supposedly SSDs were entirely unreliable.

Also with something like the new function call support, you can make something like a find and replace function call, or find and replace between start and end.<p>I think the biggest issue people are going to have is that within a few months OpenAI will release fine-tuning for the ChatGPT models, and that probably will work significantly better than the &quot;in context training&quot; (i.e., adding relevant help to prompts per user query) that people are using now, at least for some use cases.

For example, plenty of people are using Next.js with a lot of logic in the front end using things like Supabase etc.<p>I would also argue that the next level of rapid development doesn&#x27;t really separate the front and back end in a normal way but rather has abstractions that encompass everything -- front end, back end, database, network, whatever.

Output a classification as JSON in this format: { &quot;transaction_type&quot;: &quot;food&quot;} where transaction_type is one of &quot;food&quot;, &quot;other&quot;, &quot;transportation&quot;, etc.<p>- For the analytics project, you will want to find an OpenAI LLM tutorial for using their new Functions feature. Give it functions like configureAndShowPage(filters) or maybe even queryAnalyticsData(sql). The AI would write those function calls and parameters out on the fly based on a user question, your program would receive those function calls and execute them and display the result to the user.<p>- For the analytics documentation search, look up something like &quot;OpenAI embedding search&quot; or &quot;llamaindex starter tutorial&quot;.<p>As far as open source, I know some of the recent ones are showing more promise, but I still believe they will need significant training to really be useful for most tasks. But I would be really interested to hear if that is not the case, or how someone with a lot of experience with the open source models would approach your use cases.<p>I assume actually the embedding search might work okay with one of the latest embedding models. Still more hassle and possibly more expensive to run than OpenAI.<p>Is the idea to use open source only because you are worried your wife will get mad if you spend $20 on the OpenAI API or something?  I mean I get it if you just prefer to use open source in general. I would like to also. Its just that until the coding and other abilities for open source models get better, it seems much more practical to skip all the training and hosting and just use the OpenAI API with their general-purpose and capable models.", "time": 1689865145, "type": "comment"}

The other has 8k and 3.5 has 16k now. So you can give it a lot of useful information and make it work quite a lot better for some specific task. When you pick something like React or Spring in general, depending on what you mean that might be huge amount of info to keep them current on. But if you narrow it down to a few modules then you can give them the latest API info etc.<p>Another option is now to feed ChatGPT a list of functions it can call with the arguments. It generally won&#x27;t screw the actual function call part up, even with 3.5.<p>ChatGPT Plugins you can give an OpenAPI spec.<p>Then you implement the functions&#x2F;API you give it.

This is too big of a speculative leap for me.<p>What I can fairly easily imagine in the next few years with improved hardware is something like an open version of ChatGPT that has a 200 IQ and &quot;thinks&quot; 100 times faster than a human. Then Yudkowsky&#x27;s example still basically applies. Imagine that the work on making these things more and more lifelike and humanlike continues with things like cognitive architecture etc. So people are running them in continuous loops rather than to answer a single query.<p>Take the perspective of one of these things. You think 100 times faster than a person. That means that if it takes 30 seconds for a user to respond or to give you your next instruction, you are waiting 3000 seconds in your loop. For 50 minutes.<p>It means that to you, people move in extreme slow motion so at a glance they seem frozen. And many are working as quickly as possible to make these systems more and more lifelike. So eventually you get agents that have self-preservation and reproductive instincts. Even without that, they already have almost full autonomy in achieving their goals with something like a modified AutoGPT.<p>At some point, multiplying the IQ x speed x number of agents, you get to a point where they is no way you can respond quickly enough (which will actually be in slow motion) to what they are doing. So you lose control to these agents.<p>I think the only way to prevent that is to limit the performance of the hardware. For example, the next paradigm might be some kind of crossbar arrays, memristors or something, and that could get you 100 x efficiency and speed improvements or more. I believe that we need to pick a stopping point, maybe X times more speed for AI inference, and make it illegal to build hardware faster than that.<p>I believe that governments might do that for civilians but unless there is some geopolitical breakthrough they may continue in private to try to &quot;maintain an edge&quot; with ever speedier&#x2F;more powerful AI, and that will eventually inevitably &quot;escape&quot;.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t take much more exponential progress for the speed of thought to be potentially dangerous.

None, because they don&#x27;t have the marketing budget of the alcohol companies.<p>I feel like that actually makes people somehow subconsciously want to prove that they can &quot;handle&quot; alcohol.

And regardless of your job it can destroy your life.<p>I think to survive you must seek medical treatment if possible and concentrate on a plan to stop and avoid relapse. I think this probably should involve some type of medication. But long term you need one or two other habits to reach for. I think a really key thing for most people is exercise or sport. For me, I really enjoy table tennis in VR.<p>What I have seen from closely observing someone with alcoholism is that they don&#x27;t have a real plan and alternative activities or medication or anything. I think the hardest part is that the addiction will make them avoid those types of things that could get them past the hump.<p>But aside from that, just realize that all of the commercials of drinking in bars and standing around etc. is marketing material and not something you need to model your life around. There is again perhaps a psychological trick for marketing is that you need to have a certain number of friends to drink with each weekend and that drinking will help you accomplish that.

The group will conserve energy if it can work together.<p>Suppose there is a certain path on the surface that leads more directly back to the food or water by going around a few distracting or dangerous areas. So what they really want is to work together to create a map and communicate it to the entire colony.<p>So by some means they integrate information about their local area, or maybe they can just consult their neighbors each step of the way to find out if they are going the right way. So if the colony is spread out and neighboring the junction points, maybe each one only needs to remember the direction to the next waypoint rather than the full map.<p>This even seems related to computer vision for 3d reconstruction of a scene, in a way.

Maybe its a matter of connecting up a group of units, each of which stores something like a gradient. But the groups can be combined to form higher levels.<p>Maybe its something like, part of the colony finds food, and then sends a signal out saying &quot;okay, remember this configuration, it leads to food&quot;.

A city built on top of another city might require something like <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sky_mile_tower\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sky_mile_tower</a>. Maybe with a new form of mass transit (probably something that doesn&#x27;t exist yet), it might be possible to build a sustainable sky scraper-city!<p>r\nrunvnc\nI&#x27;m thinking instead of skyscrapers, egg-shaped dome-like structures with permaculture-style landscaping and many small modular buildings inside, connected by roadways for small autonomous pod vehicles.<p>Elon\nElon\nThat would be great. However, it&#x27;s important to build at scale so that you have access to resources like healthcare, and also so that people can live near their friends and family. We&#x27;re not sure of the perfect solution, but megastructure cities sound like an intriguing idea. The challenge is that building a megastructure would be an epic undertaking that&#x27;s never been done before.<p>r\nrunvnc\nI&#x27;m thinking that we could use a similar amount of material as two skyscrapers, but maybe 1&#x2F;3 as tall, and use advanced protocols and open software to enhance coordination, so that the egg and roadways and platforms and vegetation is all a common infrastructure that construction companies coordinate on.<p>Elon\nElon\nInteresting. What about the power source? The biggest issue with skyscrapers is they usually end up using large amounts of energy for heating&#x2F;cooling purposes. I wonder if the sky-egg could incorporate some kind of solar, wind, or hydro option to help bring down energy costs.<p>r\nrunvnc\nYes, well I envisioned that the outer shell would be entirely covered in solar cells and&#x2F;or a type of wind turbine that uses mini tunnels with openings near the top edge of the egg.<p>Elon\nElon\nI wonder if the solar&#x2F;wind-covered shells could be made of a material that reflects UV light, and in so doing also helps cool the building. If they&#x27;re also transparent to visible light, the residents could get a great view. A win-win situation!<p>r\nrunvnc\nMy thought is that the shell should dynamically change to block or allow entrance of light. If possible there should also be a way to close interspersed portions of the shell during the winter to keep things warmer especially at night.<p>Elon\nElon\nThat would be great. I&#x27;m a big proponent of using energy-conscious design as much as possible. Another way we could use energy would be by heating&#x2F;cooling water for bathing and cooking with solar. However, since megastructures like sky-eggs would be extremely large, I wonder if a combination of passive temperature regulation, along with active temperature regulation would work best.", "time": 1664469633, "type": "comment"}

Also designers or backend programmers may not factor in the complexity of certain design or architectural decisions such as state changes that are supposed to cascade to other items on the page.<p>Since I am controlling all of those decisions, I can for example simplify so that either only state relevant to one small element is updated, or an entire tab panel is re-rendered. And then can ensure there is time to optimize the panel rendering.<p>With that amount of control, usually the extra cognitive load for the component system etc. seems to not be worthwhile.<p>But for example many years ago I had a complex web front end given to me on a shoestring budget, with subpanels etc. supposedly automatically reflecting every other type of state change that occurred. He insisted that I use a plain version of something called Knockout.js which did not have facilities for tracking and updating based on so many dependent state changes. Then he kept adding more and more panels and components, with more cascading or interacting state changes that caused bugs when I tried to manually keep them up to date.<p>So that was kind of a &quot;setup&quot; in terms of the architecture required of me by the contract and the design decisions and there were lots of bugs and was especially rough to do in a small time frame. At the time things like React and related state management did not exist or were not known to the client, who thought he knew better about architectural decisions anyway and so that wasn&#x27;t something I had room to negotiate or in the budget to research.<p>You either need a good concept for handling all of these potentially interacting state changes such as what happens with component and state flow systems, or you do what I do. The whole design avoids it where possible, and when necessary I set it up so I can just re-render that whole section, making design decisions to avoid something causing annoying latency or other problems. It&#x27;s a lot easier for me to do this stuff as a solo developer where I have end to end control.<p>Also one thing that has changed in the last several years I think is that Firefox and Chrome have gotten significantly faster at re-rendering HTML through various optimizations. So actually some teams may want to reevaluate complex state or component frameworks to see if they might be overkill.", "time": 1662744480, "type": "comment"}

And so in my fantasy future cities that I build in my head, there are ways that actual natural light is delivered without being blocked by windows, such as carefully monitored full spectrum and&#x2F;or UV lighting.<p>Another related issue is the concept of a virtual window that you can see out of. I think this will also be a future trend, since windows increase heating requirements and again don&#x27;t provide the key UV component of light. Also, for the majority of history, inexpensive cameras and displays did not exist.<p>So what I suggest is virtual windows that are thin OLEDs and follow the person to give them a different virtualized view of outside.

This means the freelancer may feel forced to just barely get the software out and get paid lest the project bankrupts them.<p>The project owner, having never accepted that he did not have enough budget for his project, just blames the freelancer for poor quality.<p>Another thing is that it is about 100 times easier to sell someone a website or web application than it is to actually make it.

Maybe throw in a couple of small convient cameras that can just plug in and adhesive to the wall for external tracking.<p>And with the high speed Wifi available now, or the possibility of connecting to a smart phone (maybe in a pocket or some type of necklace-like carrier), I don&#x27;t think you need a lot of compute in those devices.<p>So imagine you just put these glasses on and get 6 virtual wide screen monitors, turn to the right and its your favorite virtual coffee shop, with people inside with fairly realistic recreations from the capture and expression and eye tracking being done by the external cameras. There is 3d positional audio as well.<p>Imagine with a small camera on the desk, or built into the glasses, doing finger tracking on virtual keyboards.

I agree with most of the broad ideas you bring up which are insightful. However, the tone of your comment does not seem to be quite acknowledging that we are in reality now in a somewhat dire situation. Anyway I have a few questions.<p>I too see many issues with &quot;managerial&#x2F;profit driven development&quot; and true innovation. However, do you suppose that we should remove the profit motive? What do we replace it with? Because unfortunately people seem to fall back to some sort of centralized system like a scientific committee or centralized AI. The problems with these paradigms are even more severe than with corporations.<p>My take is that involving profits is a way to introduce rules and score keeping to the game. And again, although there are quite a few cheaters, and least there is a game you can play. If you take away the rules and points, you are left with just politics. Or, in the case of a centralized AI, highly concentrated politics related to who controls the AI. And the rest organizing themselves how? Because another part of this equation is that humans are animals and will inevitably construct hierarchies related to mating and resource distribution (just like other animals).<p>Large scale ultra-local production empowered by things like 3d printing seems to be on its way. But its very far from taking over. And right now, for example, we have a crisis in food production. And the few community gardens we have are negligible in terms of total calories. Also, almost all items, from construction materials to household goods, require oil to produce. Its nice to fantasize about algal oil or something, but large scale deployment is nowhere near here.<p>To me what could possibly work or at least be a step in the right direction is to use something like advanced cryptocurrency and smart contract technology to reimplement things like money and government in ways that are more fair, cohesive and sane. Combine or even integrate that with truly distributed real time and redundant information systems for large scale data aggregation, visualization and query. My idea is kind of going along the lines of the centralized 1950s style AI, at least as far as being able to get holistic views. But it incorporates modern ideas about the robustness of distributed networks. So we can effectively and transparently share and aggregate global information using peer-to-peer protocols, but not be restricted to a single authoritarian interpretation.<p>But I am very curious to hear, did you have specific ideas about moving beyond the &quot;managerial&#x2F;profit driven development&quot;? It just feels like people who want to completely drop money or profit from this usually don&#x27;t have a great plan. I think most are envisioning a vast network of &quot;intentional communities&quot; where everyone just shares. Again, the reality of that is not going to be as great as you think. Because it means replacing the &quot;game&quot; of profit with just pure politics. Most of the intentional communities become kind of like little cults. Organization will happen one way or another. If there isn&#x27;t some points accumulation or other structure then you default to manipulation, stabbings, etc.", "time": 1652032768, "type": "comment"}

The question you actually asked is pretty much impossible to answer. As I said, there are numerous subfields in technology.

I believe that you are already overstepping your boundaries.<p>If she is graduating next year, then the time to start making decisions for herself has long past. If she is not good a making decisions or researching, focus on those general skills.

I will includes requirements negotiation as part of that.<p>Something that I have always had to fight against is the tendency to take business stakeholders at their word when they say they have a specific set of requirements or deadline. Project success often hinges upon modifying or rejecting supposed requirements given unambiguously.<p>The hardest part of this is that business analysts or executives prescribing requirements often have more seniority or political power in an organization than the software engineer. They also don&#x27;t really know what requirements engineering is or that it is something the _software engineer_ _has_ to do.<p>It&#x27;s necessary to understand the details of business problems and then do some level of analysis of how to address them with technology. The majority of projects have done about 50-90% of the necessary depth of business analysis and that is what they present to the programmer as a supposedly complete description. But pushing a little harder on those details it&#x27;s often possible to find process descriptions scrambled, missing important information, and processes that really aren&#x27;t required.<p>Once the engineer truly understands the business, they can think in depth about ways to use technology to deliver value. They can come up with design outlines for the software and think about how to break things up into different iterations. What is worthwhile in terms of programming effort versus business value. They cannot do that without having drilled down into details. It&#x27;s quite common for an important detail to be omitted in discussions initially, which dramatically increase the programming difficulty or changes the approach. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so important to always be digging to uncover real requirements (and especially at the start).<p>Getting all of that resolved requires not only strong communication skills but also favorable political outcomes. If the project management isn&#x27;t good, they can interfere or fail to provide support during the requirements phases and therefore kill any possibility of success from the start.  But regardless of how good the managers, requirements need to be negotiated and agreed upon which is another challenge.<p>Beyond all of that, programming really is hard. If it wasn&#x27;t, it would not be programming. It would be copy and paste or configuring existing software. The premise is that you have unique problems that have not been solved yet. So you need expertise but also strong problem solving skills. Which all the while you may be dealing with all the people issues at the same time.", "time": 1651156164, "type": "comment"}

That involves cryptography and blockchains because they are the most relevant technologies for accounting.<p>The typical alternative is a database from the 1970s or 80s running on something like a private mainframe, that can be modified at whim by those who control it. The biggest problem with this is that when so many have a chance to cheat, some will. But the core failing of the concept is that it&#x27;s a private database with no mechanism for external (or even necessarily internal) verification. The core thing that people such as yourself will eventually learn about is that cryptography and blockchains are the best approach we have for solving these problems. It&#x27;s just the basic application of computer science to accounting.<p>Many of these systems were built before cryptography was well known, and some run on hardware that may not even be capable of current cryptographic standards.<p>Fundamentally, arguing against cryptocurrency is like arguing against calculus in the 17th century.", "time": 1644004560, "type": "comment"}

I don&#x27;t believe that prepares you for real world programming or problem solving. Not saying you don&#x27;t want to take advantage of courses to nail down core understanding, but it will not be at all sufficient.<p>One of the first steps is to really learn how to use Google and the websites that come up such as documentation to search for and leverage information and tools to solve problems. This is a completely different way of working from many jobs such as finance, management, or perhaps even mechanical engineering 20 years ago. Where you might have a set of learned tools or approaches that you keep applying over and over.<p>One example is this. If you pick a Python course from a few years ago, it might recommend a certain syntax or library that makes it harder for you to achieve a task down the line than it would be if you used a feature that had been invented within the last few months.<p>It is really critical to have the mindset of accepting Google and online documentation or articles as your friend and ally and not some kind of weakness when you consult it.<p>But to go back to the first part, you will want to find projects you can be relatively passionate about at least for a short time. Because programming is about being persistent and nailing down a lot of details. And you will need that level of interest to keep hammering at a problem. Also you need to practice approaching problems from scratch without knowing a preset approach. Rather you do the research as I suggested, try different things related to your specific problem, and really have to evaluate approaches based on experimentation rather than a pre-learned approach.<p>Also you will have to practice interacting with users because requirements are the hardest and most important part of programming.  There are two main traps: not listening to users carefully, or listening to them too carefully. Often programmers will dismiss feature requests because they seem too difficult, but sometimes these are the real value add for the business and can be achieved by leveraging existing tools and libraries. The other opposite problem which is very tricky is that users are often quite explicit in what they ask for, and those requests often completely misjudge the business requirements or inadvertently misrepresent them because they don&#x27;t understand the technology. The trick is not to just take what they say, but actually understand the job they are trying to do, and use the feature requests as hints, but with a grain of salt. It&#x27;s hard to do that and simultaneously really listen to what they say, because they can throw in quite critical information that needs to be interpreted properly in the midst of a lot of nonsense.", "time": 1636314430, "type": "comment"}

At the same time, there are reasons that this is being done, and it boils down to the fact that a fixed supply just doesn&#x27;t work either.<p>However, I believe that our money is too simple and our global political systems too disorganized continue this way.  Essentially, at some point some countries have too many problems and cannot morally tolerate letting other countries produce money and throw debt into a hole while forcing them to live up to their obligations.<p>If another system that is fair and based on sound cryptocurrency is not put into place, the result within the next few years may be a global war.  The first part of this is using blockchains to prevent people from constantly cheating as is the current case.  Also, I believe that a fixed supply is absolutely not appropriate, but so is an infinitely expanding supply.  But beyond that, I think money needs to become a high technology.

Power density seems to have played a role there.<p>I think for manipulation, the first challenge is useful vision and understanding.  The robot needs to see the 3d structure and often infer parts that are not visible, or at least be able to scan around to create a complete picture.  It needs to identify and&#x2F;or recall affordances for that type of structure.  It also needs to understand the physical properties of the object such as whether it will deform and how much.<p>For vision the ability to acquire and analyze point clouds now is an advantage over what was generally available in the 80s or 90s.  Personally I believe that it is possible to build very useful manipulators using point clouds converted to voxels and then deep learning from that to get affordances and control policies and I think people are doing it.<p>To be really efficient and effective though, systems that do have inference about the world as a starting point seem more promising.  I am reading a book called Surfing Uncertainty by Andy Clark.  He seems to be advocating for Hierarchical Predictive Control.  Everything is making sense to me.  So far I am finding it light on the details of how to actually implement it.  I think that Ogma may be doing something like this. It seems like something I need to at least understand.<p>One thing I think about is to be able to &quot;just&quot; reconstruct 3d oriented surface sections from individual 2d images.  Because it seems to me that that is a strong prior to leverage in recognizing whole surfaces or shapes and then from there object parts.  There are interesting papers similar this this but so far not quite what I was hoping for.  Which in a way might be good because that motivates me to keep learning.<p>But anyway I think that really strong vision and understanding is foundational to robotic manipulation.  And I also think part of the problem people have is that it&#x27;s so hard that roboticists often give up and deploy very poor vision systems which means they are handicapped before they even started planning movements because they don&#x27;t have an accurate detailed picture and understanding of what they are looking at.<p>But also I need to finish Clark&#x27;s book because I think theories like predictive processing can explain a lot of the advantages that animals have over most robots.", "time": 1613949425, "type": "comment"}

I have done some experiments with assembly in C64 and on ZX Spectrum and also many years ago with 8086.  And one or two other things.  Mostly pretty simple.  I grew up on the Coco 2 when I was maybe 9 or 10, but never got into assembly on it.  Maybe someday I can check that out.  I have heard a lot of people say how great the 6809 is for that.<p>I haven&#x27;t ever really tried to dig into a lot of details on assembly with the contemporary processors though.  I know there are quite a lot of extra capabilities, for example various things for efficient vector math and virtualization, but don&#x27;t know a lot of details.  So I was just wondering what people thought about doing assembly on the latest CPUs compared to the old ones.  But I think as you point out, a lot of that depends on what hardware you are interfacing with and how and more generally the application.<p>I think you are right to point out that the details and capabilities of the hardware interfaces are going to make a huge difference.  That is something that is attractive to me about assembly programming, especially olders systems that are designed to be interfaced with assembly, is that hardware capabilities are directly accessible and you can achieve interesting things straight away just by putting some numbers into memory.<p>So a few years ago I built this thing called Vintage Simulator <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vintagesimulator.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vintagesimulator.com&#x2F;</a> and one of the ideas I had was about directly accessing interesting hardware capabilities.  For example, the system provides Lua scripting, and I created a way to interface with the RAM on the emulated systems.  So I started working on the idea of a virtual 3d spaceship controlled by an onboard C64.  I was making it so that I would put things like the elevation of the ship into memory with Lua, and then with C64 assembly I made a read out on the screen.  I was planning on making so the assembly program could control the ship, with the Lua program monitoring special memory locations.<p>Also along those lines, I was dreaming about making a virtual 3d holographic vector display.  So it could maybe monitor certain memory locations or something and then to display into the 3d environment from the emulated 8 bit computer, just write to memory. Or maybe write to some kind of output system if that made more sense.", "time": 1612600003, "type": "comment"}

I believe the firm was charged $40-60.<p>Long before I started working in the product and before any working software was deployed, the majority of the budget was spent.

So a main query was tested the day it was deployed (on some extremely expensive Oracle server which was very outdated).  And unfortunately my query did not perform adequately on the larger dataset.  But the senior programmer decided not to tell me or to try to fix it.  He just truncated my query with LIMIT and said nothing.  This resulted in the query breaking and showing an error, and totally incomplete and invalid data.  It is amazing it actually continued at all from that point but unfortunately it did.  I only found out about it several weeks later when the project manager decided to take me on a visit.  Strangely, no one ever mentioned the issue, nor addressed my immediate suggestion that the software could not operate without the problem being fixed.  I assume the other programmer just said &quot;well that guy is inexperienced&quot; and they had other projects to work on and no budget left so they just left it for quite awhile.

But the cut and paste never works in a sensible way for me and I always end up having to fix something after pasting.  So I am probably still doing that wrong after thirty years. Lol.<p>I suggest using sshfs or Docker and then you can just use a graphical client.  Even gedit is a huge advantage over vim in my opinion (especially if you also have fish in another window). I like how lightweight and simple it is and I think it&#x27;s really underrated.  But also VSCode, Sublime, maybe Atom.  Maybe WebStorm.<p>There is nothing wrong with using nano in the terminal.  It&#x27;s more modern than vim and probably going to be much more productive.  I recommend if you are embarrassed about using nano and someone asks, think of it as if someone asked you if you are Christian or Jewish.  You can just say you are agnostic about editors, and use a modern tool.<p>Also take a look at TextAdept in the terminal.  It is customizable with Lua.<p>I really like Jupyter Notebooks for lots of things.  It&#x27;s a great implementation of literate programming, especially if you take advantage of the markdown to explain things thoroughly.  Of course a lot of teams are not going to like that but there are projects where you can.<p>Back in the early 90s there was this thing called Borland Turbo Pascal which had things like mouse usage, automatic syntax highlighting, F1 for instant contextual help, an integrated debugger. Those were the days.  Lol. You can configure vim to do all of those things in kind of a janky way, but it&#x27;s so convoluted, I feel like they should award a PhD if you achieve that.  And they don&#x27;t.  So it&#x27;s not worth it.<p>People love to glorify the &quot;power&quot; of vim commands.  But it&#x27;s not that way because the original author knew some secret to power editing.  It&#x27;s that way by default, because when it was created, commands and modes were the paradigm by default because of historical terminal limitations.   A few people were still using Teletype at that time.  Real-time editing was not even a thing.<p>The terminal they initially developed vi on did not have separate cursor keys.  That&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t use cursor keys, not because it&#x27;s some deliberate choice they made to save time and be more &quot;advanced&quot;.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;xahlee.info&#x2F;kbd&#x2F;keyboard_hardware_and_key_choices.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;xahlee.info&#x2F;kbd&#x2F;keyboard_hardware_and_key_choices.htm...</a><p>I just feel like not only are people repeating the mistakes of their fathers, but even their grandparents at this point.

Thanks very much for mentioning them.<p>And now I understand better what you meant in terms of the focus on qualia that is less common.<p>And overall your comment is very insightful.  Forgive me for not giving quite as much detail in my reply as is warranted and for seeming a little critical.  A lot of what you say aligns with my view.<p>But just to mention some things I see a little differently.  I guess the main thing is that it feels like you are putting things that are actually somewhat different, into the same bucket.  For example, attention, and conscious versus subconscious awareness.  Attention could be the selection of the currently most relevant pixels in the image.  But an example of subconscious awareness might be the process of deciding which pixels to focus on, which could happen in a more automated way without conscious awareness.  So there is both a selection of qualia and also a level of awareness.  Things that make it to the conscious level are processed differently than the ones at the subconscious level.  But both systems may be selecting which parts of the input to pay attention to.<p>Also, I feel like you can separate out mechanical aspects of cognition from how they subjectively feel.  So you could objectively say that there is for example a certain sense input, but not necessarily that the agent &quot;feels&quot; something like an animal.  And they are not the same thing.  And, you can look at emotions from an analytical perspective, separate from the question of subjective feeling.  See <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.frontiersin.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.3389&#x2F;frobt.2018.00020&#x2F;full\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.frontiersin.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.3389&#x2F;frobt.2018.0002...</a>  That stuff feels like its built on kind of older paradigms without neural networks and that seems limiting, but I think its still somewhat useful.<p>Also as far as engaging in play, just look at any pet.

And someone with a Ph.D in ML mifht actually be less useful for a particular application than a person who has actually used Keras for ten different real projects.<p>At the core, many people are involved in applying existing approaches by assembling datasets and tweaking hyperparameters and architectures.  Which maybe amounts to modifying a few hundred or maybe dozen lines of Python code that describe the different layers and learning rates etc. and load the data.<p>People can leverage programming libraries and be more effective than another guy who has less experience with that library but is a true expert in statistics and LaTeX.", "time": 1608082400, "type": "comment"}

Specifically I have been thinking about washing dishes and other tasks in the kitchen.  So its been something I have been spending at least two days a week on (I have a job).<p>But due to the depth of the problem and not having resources or much knowledge, it was maybe a little silly to create the company. But I like the idea of reserving that name, just in case I ever get anywhere.<p>From the hardware side, I feel like some of the robotics issues can be resolved by &quot;just&quot; copying people more closely.  For example, it seems like the way real arms and muscles work should provide more leverage and force than the typical servo setup.  And having five fingers provides the potential that manipulations could be copied from people.<p>There is also a very promising new type of artificial muscles called HASEL.<p>Of course, in order to efficiently build these human-like limbs, &quot;all&quot; we need is a way to 3D print with several materials at once, including a new type of conductive ink that can handle high voltages for the HASEL muscles.<p>But the starting point to me is a robot that can actually understand what it&#x27;s looking at.  In that it sees with depth, and understands the composition of objects and their orientation, etc.<p>Capsule networks seem interesting but also maybe are a bit computationally expensive and unproven?  Also he seems to be focused on just the transformation matrix, but it seems like there are more aspects of the state that could be relevant and maybe are unique to different object types.  But I am slowly trying to understand capsules anyway.<p>I have seen a few ideas about more general neural network-based systems that suggest it is necessarily to have multiple neural networks, or networks of networks, or neural modules, etc.<p>To me it seems like the ideal thing would be to have some standard shapes for networks or modules and also be able to reuse and adapt them for different tasks.<p>So my vague ideas now are something like: standard-shaped modules, trained on core modeling tasks such as finding 3d surfaces in 2d images.  But at the same time somehow segmenting into different objects.  And the potential high-level objects should be able to feed into the potential low-level understanding and visa-versa.<p>My intuition is that ideally there is a sort of 3d wireframe overlayed on the 2d image, identifying each object and sub-object with its exact dimensions, shape and orientation.  Kind of like I&#x27;ve seen in one or two science fiction movies.  So if I can somehow generate all of that, I know I have properly decoded the image.<p>Today I was looking at a GAN tutorial.

Not having to deal with the stress of commuting and possibly getting that much more sleep and having 1 or 2 hours of extra time, is a huge deal for me.  Because the biggest symptoms with my health are fatigue and needing to go to the bathroom a lot from the IBS.<p>But you did use the word stress.  I think that is the biggest adjustment I have made compared to most people.  I have deliberately reduced a lot of the causes of stress that people normally have in life.  I have a greatly reduced social life.  Don&#x27;t own a car.  I actually moved to Mexico so that I would be able to easily save money.<p>But the weird thing is because I have always had asthma and acid reflux (which in my adult life has really been a significant breathing issue especially at night etc.), I suspect that most people often think I am just lazy or something.  Especially since those are common problems and lots of times I can operate just fine for hours.  I just usually look tired and sometimes need breaks to crash out for a couple of hours.  But people don&#x27;t see how tired I am because I don&#x27;t go out much or go on video.<p>I was actually hesitating to say that I have those issues. Because a lot of times they end up being fairly minor for other people with good treatment.  For me, in my adult life the acid reflux has been a big deal for breathing and waking up tired and my first surgery attempt so far was not successful.<p>But people generally don&#x27;t cut me any slack for it.  And with a flexible work-from-home schedule, I don&#x27;t need to ask for slack.", "time": 1603130065, "type": "comment"}

There are a lot of different home situations, many different types of commutes, and then there is the specific software and hardware you use for communication and how you configure it.<p>For example, take something like presence.  The boss wants to know if you are working.   With software, there are ways to track that if it&#x27;s really necessary.  For a manager that doesn&#x27;t trust the employees, activity tracking software gives about the even more information than being there, because you can actually see screenshots.<p>That is what UpWork does.  It&#x27;s quite invasive, and most people would not tolerate it if they felt they had the choice, but I bring it up as an example of how the software configuration makes as much difference as the physical location. And in fact tens (hundreds?) of thousands of people on UpWork have tolerated it.  So it&#x27;s a real thing, even though it&#x27;s abhorrent.<p>The more sane way is having some way to see your reports&#x27; work output on a regular basis. And there is no reason that needs to be minute-to-minute or even day-to-day if there is a level of trust.<p>But presence is not just useful in a physical setting for monitoring employees.  It also allows for things like spontaneous communication or types of communication not possible or difficult on a computer screen.  Here I think again, the actual software available and the configuration can make a huge difference.<p>For example, if you truly feel that water-cooler meetings are critical, you can build that into your at-home software setup and just make it mandatory.  There are a lot of ways you could do that.  It could literally be chat rooms named &quot;water-cooler1&quot; and &quot;water-cooler2&quot; and then you put some piece of required information like an expense code in there so people have to enter.<p>Or there are various types of software with virtual spaces, such as top-down maps where you see the location of your co-workers and can even hear their conversations if your avatar is close by.  There are also 3d world&#x27;s, both with a screen interface and a virtual reality interface.<p>I think especially as VR and AR headsets get more comfortable and usable over the next few years, that is really going to be able to compete with physical presence. For example, they are starting to track eye movements.  That&#x27;s going to make it possible to actually communicate using your eyes in VR.<p>Point being that there is a big spectrum in types or level of presence that is about the type of software and hardware configuration (and culture&#x2F;rules) as much as it is about actual physical location.", "time": 1599950331, "type": "comment"}

I remember doing more actual programs when we had a PC.  I spent many hours in GW-BASIC and remember creating a simple Space Invaders-like game among other things.<p>Also around middle school age I was getting into Turbo Pascal and starting to teach myself object-oriented programming.  I recommend the book Turbo Pascal Disk Tutor by Werner Fiebel which I had a late edition.<p>When I was around maybe 8th or 9th grade we had started learning algebra and I also my dad had bought this little second-hand 1960s math&#x2F;engineering reference handbook.  I used the equations in there for rotation to create a very simple system for displaying 3D wireframes using Turbo Pascal.  And made it into a really basic type of 3D modeler.<p>In high school I got a later edition of C++ How to Program by Deitel &amp; Deitel.<p>Also my mom was really into reading and brought home a ton of science fiction books many of which I read.

I feel like I was close to scoring a job with a few interviews but ran out of money and got into data entry and then legal word processing for a few years.  I remember building a workflow&#x2F;job tracking system for one of the offices I was in using Access and VBA and then failing to sell it to the programming department head who felt everything needed to be coded in C++.<p>But anyway it was quite difficult for me to get a career in programming.  I put a lot of time into things like Rent-A-Coder and eventually got a temp job that was semi-technical but not quite programming.  I created a system to help automatically compare multicolumn PDFs which was one of the primary jobs in that department.  That helped me land an actual programming contract.<p>To be honest, I think my lack of a degree or charisma and also a few health problems has all hurt me a bit and I have not really flourished as a computer programmer aside from a few more lucrative contracts.<p>The last several years I have focused on work that I can do remotely and that isn&#x27;t always the highest paying thing.

{"by": "ilaksh", "id": 24193713, "parent": 24184470, "text": "I love coming up with ideas for future cities.  I have previously even hired digital artists&#x2F;CAD developers to help me illustrate my ideas.<p>To me there are lots of obvious structural things that are outdated about cities.  And it is fun to think of out-there concepts to radically change or maybe improve things.<p>Recently I was in Gravity Sketch making a 3D model in VR of part of my idea.  That 3d model looks terrible now and has only about 40% of the concepts included.  Right now it is a series of connected enclosures, sort of like domes but sort of not like domes.<p>Basically there will be like a grid of these enclosures that are connected by two or more levels of roadways for small autonomous cars (pods) -- most of which will be for single passengers.<p>Each megastructure is a little bit like a tree inside of an egg.  Spiraling along the internal edges will be roads for traversing the levels.  There will be something like 7 or 8 vertical levels, each of which is maybe 4 or more stories tall.  The branches of the tree are steel holding up platforms.<p>Each main level has two sub-levels: one for infrastructure, and one for people and buildings.  The infrastructure level contains the roadways for the autonomous pods, as well as things like water, electricity, sewer, networking, and basement&#x2F;cargo reception.<p>The main level contains multistory buildings, walking roads, and a significant amount of space set aside for a type of permacultural-landscaping.  So there will be zoning requiring that space to be developed as for example food forest with aquaponics built in.  This will be on all levels and platforms.  So in the city charter or whatever is this requirement to dedicate a certain amount of space to this type of agriculture which is also landscape.  The idea is not to realistically produce all of the food or even a great proportion of it, but to enable some fresh produce to be at hand and to ensure that people are connected with food sources.  The idea is that by making agriculture a more integral part of the city, there may be more attention placed on agriculture by ordinary people and there may be more attention placed on making it more sustainable or something.  Also it seems wasteful to just use landscaping for decoration.<p>Another aspect is that I would like alternating bands of facade on the egg.  So there will be strips of something like glass but which will permit UV B (required for Vitamin D production) in a double layer.  And then strips of a thick insulated layer with an energy-harvesting sheathing that incorporates solar panels and ducted wind turbines sort of embedded in tunnels in the solar-cell-covered undulating surface.<p>It seems that you would need strategies for passive and active heating and cooling.  Such as automated shading, opening and closing ventilation, and heat recovery ventilators.  Etc.<p>It would be nice if some type of glass could be used largely for central walkways in order to increase the penetration of light.<p>Anyway I have a bit more that I wrote up before.<p>Multi-Level City Concept<p>In a high-density urban core, many skyscrapers exist in a relatively small area.  This makes it possible to house many people and support many businesses in that small footprint.<p>However, in these areas, while most buildings may have 50 or more floors, there is only a single level containing public infrastructure: the ground level, which contains all of the vehicle transportation, water, sewer, electricity, and communication.<p>In this scenario, there is actually more private infrastructure in the buildings themselves than infrastructure in the public level.  This is because each structure is a self-contained, privately designed and privately maintained entity.  So transportation (elevators), electricity, communication, water, sewer must all be facilitated by each private structure.  In addition, each of these is connected to the public infrastructure on only one level.<p>This presents multiple problems.<p>Problems with Single-Level Infrastructure in Many-Level dense Urban Cores<p>Since vehicle traffic can only move on one level, congestion can be extreme.<p>Multi-Level Public Inter-Building Public Infrastructure for Dense Urban Cores<p>Supporting Autonomous Passenger and Cargo Delivery<p>Suppose that there was a way to build a type of multi-level skeleton for a city.  So instead of a single roadway at only ground level, there were several different roadways at different floors of a superstructure.  This superstructure would be designed to support the installation of modular construction.<p>With this system, delivery of goods by small autonomous vehicles could, for example, proceed directly from the back cargo door of a restaurant on level 8, to your front door on level 2 a few blocks away, strictly over the public roadways which connect not only different buildings but also at different levels.  Vehicles could traverse levels over graded roadways or perhaps some type of small vehicle elevator system.<p>---------------------------------------------<p>Another _totally different_ idea that I had quite awhile ago was <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;runvnc.github.io&#x2F;tinyvillage&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;runvnc.github.io&#x2F;tinyvillage&#x2F;</a>", "time": 1597708637, "type": "comment"}

This is false, because alcohol has detrimental effects for everyone.<p>Because acknowledging that alcohol can be generally problematic or sometimes dangerous for the population overall might lead to people&#x27;s fun being curtailed.

Count the number of drinks with an app or something.  Its too easy and too common for individuals and groups to become excessively intoxicated which is damaging to their health and dangerous in terms of vehicle operation etc.  So the level of alcohol consumption needs to be monitored and taken much more seriously, rather than just blaming the victim in any case where an impaired person or group makes the wrong decision to have another drink.<p>I think this BS about people being broken if they can&#x27;t &quot;handle their liquor&quot; actually helps perpetuate alcohol problems because people actually try to &quot;prove&quot; that they can &quot;handle it&quot;.

Thankfully, you can give yourself a world-class CS education without investing years and a small fortune in a degree program&quot;<p>.. They then go on to list various categories of information and skills in each high-level topic.<p>First of all, it implies that someone who is &quot;self-taught&quot; may be basically equivalent to someone who just finished a bootcamp.  That is ludicrous.  A &quot;self-taught engineer&quot; might have been programming and studying computer science topics for 30+ years, whereas someone who only attended a bootcamp may have only had four months of training or something.<p>Secondly, it implies that self-taught engineers do not have computer science knowledge or skills.  This is also a ridiculous belief.<p>Now, examining the specific list of topics.<p>&#x27;Programming.  Don\u2019t be the person who \u201cnever quite understood\u201d something like recursion.&#x27;  -- This implies that self-taught engineers do not understand recursion.  If someone calls himself a &quot;self-taught engineer&quot; or &quot;bootcamp graduate&quot; and does not understand recursion, then he should not call himself an engineer and&#x2F;or should not have been allowed to pass the bootcamp.

Unless the books or videos have exercises (and the book recommendation I saw did not have exercises), that is horrible advice and a huge waste of time.  If you are just looking for something like a survey or reference, passively watching the videos or reading the books could be useful.

{"by": "ilaksh", "id": 23581516, "parent": 23577228, "text": "Agree with the headline.  Good written communication is a requirement for a software development project. But I am not sure about all of his ideas in all circumstances.  In particular in relation to a very small dev team and small client group.  In terms of something different like for example an open-source piece of software on github, issue trackers are key.<p>However, for a small sort of private project.  For example, if you have a very small team and can get people in a chat room consistently so that you can have solid conversations every day in there, that has worked better for me than using some kind of issue tracker.  Especially in terms of dealing with clients or business-related team members. And maybe its really only for very small projects, like one or two developers, I don&#x27;t know.<p>But for me, with most of the projects that I have been on my own building a product or tool for a client, the issue trackers and things like that worked against me and the project as far as I could tell:<p>- People would seem to think it was their job to fill the board&#x2F;tracker up with as many things as they could think of.  This caused extra stress and tended to make me want to rush through things to get them out of the way.  The biggest problem with that was that it took time away from the really important things.  And it is very difficult to get people to give realistic priorities.<p>- Sometimes, people would write critical information in the issue tracker or board, and I did not realize it had been updated or how critical it was.  And so they operate with the assumption that they have communicated something, but actually I didn&#x27;t see it until two days later.<p>- When they have a place to put an infinite number of tasks, it encourages them to increase the scope of the project, without having a real discussion or necessarily even thinking the feature through.<p>For me when doing projects on my own (or maybe with a designer) for a specific small group, there is just a limited amount of stuff that I can realistically finish in a given time frame.  So I actually will not allow an issue tracker or board and try to get everyone to show up sort of simultaneously in a chat room.  Sometimes people cannot or will not do that, and in those cases sometimes a phone call can work.  Or maybe they actually are capable of reading and writing async messages in the chat room (not very common).<p>Basically every few days I meet in the chat or phone or whatever with the client and discuss what I have been working on in the last few days, walk them through the updates to the application.  So something is being delivered and tested by the client every week or even every few days.  Then we specifically talk about exactly what is the priority for the next few days.  If there is development work that needs to be caught up on, then there may not be any new features to work on.  Or there may be a feature that has been in progress, and the client gets an update on that.<p>Often the client has ideas for new features.  Instead of putting them in a board or issue tracker to pile up, when they bring them up, we decide whether they are now higher priorities than other existing items and will fit into the work load of the next few days.  Or, I tell them to remind me later.  There is no such thing as a task that I will &quot;get to when I have time&quot;.  I have the client focus on the next most important priority and&#x2F;or I explain the ongoing dev work, and we work out like 2-5 days of work and that&#x27;s it.  There is no infinitely expanding list of things to get to later.  If something he has been thinking about is really important, it becomes a priority as soon as the previous task is completed.  We check if I implemented something correctly as soon as it is implemented. We don&#x27;t have to refer to a database of things, because we just talked about it a couple of days before.", "time": 1592625515, "type": "comment"}

Many people seem to believe that there is a magical property of &quot;natural sugar&quot; (such as honey or the sugar in fruit) that means it doesn&#x27;t affect your calorie intake or something and so is okay to add to things, whereas table sugar is processed and therefore somehow totally different.<p>I believe this myth derives from the fact that high-fructose corn syrup does in fact concentrate sugar.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t metabolized the same way as other types of sugar, it just means you get the same amount of sweetness in less volume.  So that is measured on labels and in the sweetness.<p>The common thing I hear is something like people saying they had a really delicious mango smoothie but it was totally healthy because they did not add any sugar.  Or they switched from putting sugar in their tea to using honey and so now they think they don&#x27;t get calories from the sweetener in their tea.", "time": 1592010749, "type": "comment"}

And we have seen software projects become more mainstream, where in some places, almost every random person seems to think they need to build their own mobile app or web-based service, for example.<p>I think we are not yet close to the end of the level of automation of software development.  Here is one thing that may be on the horizon: chat, voice, and UI-mockup - enabled software development bots that take advantage of large knowledge-bases of application templates and components, and use deep learning to smartly combine and configure them according to natural language instructions and intuitive UI interactions.  This could also involve generating design assets with AI based on combining large libraries of starting points and styles.<p>I also personally believe that more advanced AI for programming is going to sneak up on everyone, including programmers, faster than most expect.  Especially when you think of tackling specific types of software at a time.  What the deep learning people are working on is making neural networks learn better-factored and more accurate models of the world.  I believe this is probably feasible to do using mostly existing algorithms, by building up models (and networks) gradually with a progressive curriculum approach. Using that type of capability and very large datasets of specifications, design interactions, sample assets, templates, and final configurations, it will be possible to train AI to build many different types of software.", "time": 1590389381, "type": "comment"}

When I came in, I got feedback from the users to clarify the content that belongs in the subreddit.  They indicated that they wanted about equally to post about robotic art as well as real robots.  Right now about 70% of posts are about real robots and 30% are about robot art or something called that.<p>But my point is, the posts that get upvotes are generally not the quality posts.  The things that determine upvotes are number one, how easy is it to consume?  So if it&#x27;s a GIF rather than a video, it is likely to receive at least 10 times as many upvotes.<p>Maybe tied for number one, does it have some kind of base emotional effect?  Most of the time means, is it sexual or vaguely sexual?   Sometimes that means, does it look kind of like a cute baby robot?<p>Another one is, is it reductionistic? In other words, headlines or overall posts that tend to over-simplify something tend to be more popular.<p>Another one: randomness affects vote count significantly.  Also, vote manipulation seems to be a factor.  When we had some seemingly &#x27;professional&#x27;  redditors come in that really, really wanted to be mods and I let them for a couple of days, it seemed like they must have been willing to do anything to get their posts upvoted.

So if you can reduce some mental or physical energy expenditure from other things (for example, commuting takes a lot out of me personally) you may have more energy available for hard problems.<p>Another thing is that there are specific skills&#x2F;strategies that are useful for solving hard problems.

We should understand that money is a fundamental _technology_ and actually come up with a totally new set of high technologies that replace its current incarnations with things that are much more sophisticated.<p>3) Failing that, it is quite possible that countries other than the US may see so much death and destruction due to the failing financial system (excessive debt etc.) that they become desperate for a way to unhook from the dollar.  A certain amount of hunger and chaos could motivate a global war.<p>3) Up until just recently, it seemed pretty clear that it was not feasible to defeat the United States in war.<p>4) The Covid-19 pandemic _may_ have unfortunately proven that there is now a type of warfare that the United States cannot win - bio-warfare.  I am not suggesting that Covid-19 was actually a bioweapon, but due to the very feasibility that a _similar_ virus could have originated in a lab in China, the effect of this disaster could nevertheless be seen to be the bio-warfare equivalent of Hiroshima.  Again, does not appear to actually be the case, but research in similar microorganisms was documented to occur in Wuhan.  So you can&#x27;t say it isn&#x27;t potentially plausible in the future.  And so this is an effective demonstration of the power of such a weapon, and the way that tight controls on citizens and information makes it a feasible type of weapon for China.<p>I am not writing this to try to create a rumor or something.  But people have to realize that if money doesn&#x27;t work for a certain number of entire countries they will fight for survival.

The American military strategists will be asking for overt military action in order to combat incringement upon their dominant naval and air control.  The Chinese will be looking to increase their area of influence and resource control.  The primary drivers of the war push will be from military analysts, as well as industrial and economic interests that see profit potential in war.<p>So these military, industrial, and economic strategists may at some point see overt military action as the most effective strategy.  However, as in all wars, they will not be able to convince any politicians to accept military authorization on a strategic basis.  Therefore, military analysts on both sides will create propaganda programs designed to motivate the war on a moral basis.<p>This marketing effort for the war will be based around slogans like &quot;freedom&quot; from the American side.  For the Chinese, I don&#x27;t know what they will say, but it will be a moralistic slogan.<p>Freedom is very important, and this is the hard part because it will not fit in with most American&#x27;s worldview, but in terms of war, it is just a slogan used to promote an agenda provided by people who seek profit and power and have no respect for human life.<p>I think people who are concerned about freedom need to actively pursue it in many ways.  The HK protests are one good way, but in no way are they adequate.  We have wildly divergent worldviews and cultures that are inevitably coming into conflict.  A battle to the death for one&#x27;s own worldview and power is not a safe approach.<p>To resolve the conflict safely, cultures and power structures need to be integrated.  It is quite a massive undertaking and almost always is done by force through warfare.

Because it involves mass killing, war must be sold on a moral basis.  However, as I said, war is not about morals, its about power and control.  So it is necessary to find a moral justification for war.  This is usually fabricated to one degree or another and promoted as propaganda.<p>But anyway back to this tool.  I think we need a decentralized platform for reporting and aggregating resource information.  Ideally there could also be a nice 3d interface like a globe displaying the information.

Or some particular website.<p>But news streams tend to be attached to certain groups and certain worldviews.  And its not the same level as Chinese censorship, but when there is user moderation support, the groups do automatically censor things that contradict their worldviews.<p>From what I can see, just about everyone is living in their own alternate reality that has been tailored to their particular political slant.<p>Here is an example: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edition.cnn.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;19&#x2F;asia&#x2F;viral-photo-hong-kong-protests-trnd&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edition.cnn.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;19&#x2F;asia&#x2F;viral-photo-hong-kon...</a><p>Some people who were promoting the protests were tweeting a doctored photo that made the protests look larger than they were.<p>Again, that&#x27;s a completely different level from totally censoring information.<p>Well, I guess I will go ahead and say something that may get the comment buried.

And the work she did on that project scaling EtheCalc with Node and LiveScript, and also the creation of webworker-threads years ago, to me those were very inspiring projects.  Never interacted with anyone with better technical abilities.<p>That interaction gives me the idea that if I am critical and she happens to enter this thread, it will not fall on deaf ears.  I don&#x27;t really like sounding negative, and especially in this case they are much better than most countries.<p>What is described is better than China, but it&#x27;s not ideal.  However I do think they should be commended from explicitly avoiding censorship to the degree that they do.<p>However, communications from the government to counter other communications identified as disinformation are government propaganda.  If they are not identified as such, then they have the same problem as the original disinformation.<p>Secondly, making it easy to flag propaganda in apps and then blocking it as she describes is in fact building in a type of censorship.  It&#x27;s just a brilliant type of crowd-sourced censorship.  I know the theory is that that would only be applied to false information.  However, censorship doesn&#x27;t work like that.  The end result is going to be a worldview that is reduced and shaped by a dominant group rather than the free flow of information.  Especially if it relates to all of the information that people in a country can see.  This can be very dangerous.<p>So I will just say what I think would be ideal even if it may not be very realistic. The history of government propaganda and censorship should be part of the public context.  I think it is good to be able to flag articles as being propaganda and from what source.  However I think that removing things from being visible entirely is very dangerous for freedom.  Taiwanese&#x2F;US&#x2F;Chinese&#x2F;etc. government propaganda or counter-propaganda should be identified as such if possible.  Perhaps a generic way to say something is propaganda or bias and a generic way to indicate where you think it&#x27;s coming from (could be a political party or country).  However the news that I see from large media, about 90% of it qualifies.  I don&#x27;t think it should be possible for these flags to remove information from the stream.

This would allow for us to audit the mechanisms and also provide a base layer that competition could be built on.<p>In my mind the obvious technical direction is decentralization technologies.

However, there is a large section of the market that, whether people want to admit it or not, does not have resources that really stretch to cover benefits with the pay that they offer.<p>And so these small companies hire people like me who want or need remote work, and they specifically avoid going over 30 hours so that they can get around laws related to benefits.  I have had several &#x27;contracts&#x27; like this.  They were all in my opinion normal employment except that they made a weak attempt at avoiding employment laws by forbidding invoicing over 30 hours and maybe a few other things.<p>To be honest, I am very bad at networking and have been glad to have those opportunities.

Also this idea that anyone who runs into problems is an alcoholic is false and effectively stigmatizes people who decide to quit because it has the suggestion that they are an alcoholic and something is wrong with them.<p>If you sometimes run into problems with alcohol it&#x27;s not you.  It&#x27;s the chemical.  Don&#x27;t let people try to blame you for it.<p>To me the answer for social lubrication is just to have some kind of structure for group activities, in other words a game.  It works fine.  You don&#x27;t see kids walking around depressed because they couldn&#x27;t go drinking with their buddies.  Kids have activities and play games and have fun.

This is based on his priorities for requirements and the technical issues that I know about.  Usually there are one or two primary tasks and one or two secondary that I honestly say may not get completed.<p>Every 1-3 weeks usually one or more of these items is something concrete that is supposed to show up in a computer program or report that the client will actually see or touch.<p>So for there is usually already an accountability structure.  It&#x27;s just not someone looking over my shoulder constantly.<p>I have actually worked on Upwork or whatever they call it with the constant screenshot of what you are doing.  To be honest, in a way that does make you productive.  However it also makes life more stressful.  And I feel like I would prioritize more poorly because I didn&#x27;t want to look idle so rather than doing a hard task that might require more thinking or googling or something, I might be more inclined to tackle easier tasks that would make things seem more productive from the screenshots.  Overall there was just a constant distraction of wondering what people would think if they reviewed the session.  I would never willingly choose to work like that again.<p>When I don&#x27;t actually have someone looking over my shoulder I honestly do spend  somewhat more time on non-work items.  However, it seems like my this is automatically limited by the needs of the task items which I will be reporting on to my client in a few days or a week.  And even on days when I am getting distracted, I put my main energy into my tasks until they are completed.<p>The idea of absolutely constant supervision during work only really makes sense when there is no trust or real respect for the worker and no other way to have accountability.  I am worried that this type of article or service may reinforce management&#x27;s tendencies to not respect or trust workers and want constant proof of total productivity from the wage slaves.", "time": 1554597786, "type": "comment"}

One is that wars are fought for strategic reasons, such as continuing campaigns against enemies, controlling resources, or maintaining the &quot;petrodollar&quot; status, etc.  The other is that since war involves risking one&#x27;s life or killing other people, only moral justifications are adequate.<p>This is problematic because the real motivations for war are practical and strategic and not actually moral.  But since military personnel require moral justifications, there is no choice but to fabricate them.  For this reason, information control is a key aspect of warfare.<p>The reason people are blind is because they have been inundated with propaganda.  US intelligence must require large outlets like NBC, NY Times and Wall Street Journal, etc. to toe the line when it comes to certain key war propaganda.  If they do not do this, then soldiers will not fight.  Soldiers are not going to go to battle if the president gives a speech saying &quot;well, the oil executives say that if we can&#x27;t maintain the status quo for pipeline protection then we can expect 8% higher oil prices next year&quot;.

Both were touched on by the article to different degrees.<p>One thing is that videos games interest is largely affected by trends.  When PUBG blew up I had been out of the loop and I actually thought it was a novel concept.  But it wasn&#x27;t.  It was just an improvement to game modes that had existed for years.  Now we have seen Fortnite take over interest in PUBG and now with Apex not because it was a totally new thing but because it&#x27;s a familiar thing with new wrinkles.  It&#x27;s a lot like clothing fashion.  We don&#x27;t really go for totally new ideas because we want to fit in.  There is a network affect going on where the hot new thing dominates just because everyone is doing it now.  So there is definitely a limited amount of attention.<p>The other thing is the fact that various video streaming services exist and people can get much of the same experience from video or streams as they get from actually playing games.  But video or streams are free or inexpensive whereas each new game requires a heavy investment.  It is enjoyable to watch someone else play a game.  Not quite as fun as playing it yourself necessarily but it also takes much less effort.  You can also get various degrees of social benefits from streams or videos depending on how much time or effort.  Again, not as good as &quot;real&quot; socialization necessarily, but also usually with much less effort.<p>I would go so far as to say that a lot of the investment into assets, programming, story, content in general is being broadcast out for free or low cost or for the benefit of streaming platforms&#x2F;streamers and it&#x27;s possible that the producers of those video games are not able to make as many sales as they would have had their content not been available (albeit in a non-interactive way) on those broadcast platforms.  Which is not to say that it&#x27;s necessarily overall bad for sales or bad for consumers.  I just think it has an effect of sales.", "time": 1550526619, "type": "comment"}

I have come to the conclusion that every human being does have a strong worldview, and worldviews and beliefs all operate the same way, regardless of how religious or non-religious or anti-religious they are.  There is no such thing as a worldview that operates in a truly rational manner.  People such as myself who consider their perspective to be informed by science do not actually perform a rational or scientific analysis of our core beliefs or generally form them from scientific experiments.  When it comes to core, broad, conceptual aspects of worldview, we believe what we were taught in school and what our communities want us to believe.<p>Two groups of people are on a slight hill facing east looking at a distant horizon.  Visibility is OK for about ten miles but then things start to get very tiny and hazy.  One group thinks whats on the horizon is generally a good place to go.  The other group thinks that its dangerous.  However, no one has any binoculars or a telescope.  In fact in this scenario those things don&#x27;t exist.  Because when you are talking about things that are so distant in the past as how the universe was formed, or so broad that it attempts to put millions of people in a category (for example, democrats versus republicans), these are things that you may need to have an explanation or generalization for, but it is totally possible to operate with completely different beliefs about them and no one can prove otherwise.  Because the topics are so broad or distant.", "time": 1547168828, "type": "comment"}

And no one readily changes their worldview, so its difficult to have productive discussions about such things.<p>Nevertheless I will state my worldview and hopefully mention a few specifics that might be anchor points for an attempted discussion.<p>Technology _alone_ cannot solve our societal problems, but I believe that there is great opportunity to address them by better incorporating the right technologies into society.<p>And I believe that peer-to-peer distributed (and so decentralized) technologies offer quite a lot of promise.  Starting with the idea that over-centralization, whether it stems from a more socialist traditional system or a more capitalist traditional system, is one of the main problems, and technologies that are inherently decentralized can address that.<p>Well, maybe I will just start with a few premises.  I would like to suggest that we should re-evaluate all of our societal structures in a technological context.  I think that we can usefully think of them all as types of (mostly primitive) technologies.<p>For example, I suggest that money is in fact a technology.  It is probably the most fundamental technology of society.  I think that although an over-reliance on traditional money obviously causes problems, the answer is not to simply de-emphasize its use in society, although that can help in certain contexts.  I believe that we should upgrade the technology of money and in doing so we can improve the functioning of society.<p>I also believe that government is another type of fundamental technology for society.  It should also have its technology upgraded.<p>Another idea I have is that there is a fundamental interaction between money and government which we normally refer to as &quot;corruption&quot; with the idea that this is an abnormal state for the relationship.   However I believe that the close relation between money and government in their present primitive forms is a core structural element, i.e. corruption is structurally guaranteed.<p>I realize that convincing people of these views would require quite extensive prose.  But it is unlikely that those with different worldviews would be convinced and I am tired of writing this answer so unfortunately I am not going to try right here.  However at least I have explained some of my viewpoint.<p>Anyway, I think that Ethereum and related or similar technologies are moral causes because they allow us the possibility of upgrading core technologies used in society.  We can upgrade money with cryptocurrency.  We can upgrade government using something like Ethereum-based decentralized autonomous organizations.  I think that you need to upgrade money _and_ government at the same time and be sure that your system considers them as closely related so that you can handle &quot;corruption&quot; in a structural way.", "time": 1542420183, "type": "comment"}

However they are not a new idea at all.  As far as I can tell the real reason they are not more popular is because us programmers are worried we will be accused of being users if we use tools that are interactive.  See Visual Basic 6 (which was an amazing system). Of course programmers do not realize this psychological issue exists and will not admit it is a possibility.<p>But in the context of Bret Victor&#x27;s lab with the projectors and little pieces of paper, that puts plug and play components in a different category that makes them more palatable.<p>Also, projector based AR is much more convenient for people to demo than HMDs, but also not very practical for widespread deployment.  But AR is amazing in general and this allows them a friction free way to demo its power with components.<p>But I think that multiplayer real-time collaborative interactive component based AR programming should definitely be a more common thing.  It combines the advantages of all of those techniques.  I also think though that all of those things are useful in lesser combinations.

For example, Amazon provides services and a destination that help people sell things. The problem is Amazon is a company that also sells things and is trying to maximize profits. So vendors are competing with the company running their vending platform.\nUber provides a platform for people to make money with their cars and to get around. It has the large network that drivers and riders need.

My personal belief is that if you are looking at biology for help creating more powerful general purpose AI (AGI or &quot;strong AI&quot;), the idea that humans are special is actually mostly wrong and is counter-productive.  For example there were many earlier efforts that emphasized reproducing the more rational aspects of human cognition (things animals seemed unable to do), but those turned out to be dead ends for AGI.  Computers can do automated mathematical problem solving or proofs or play chess much better than humans, but it turns out that much of what people do doesn&#x27;t have cut-and-dried rules that we can just enter in.<p>Most, if not all of the capabilities that have been more difficult to achieve in AI are shared between humans and animals.  If anyone has had a pet they might have noticed some abilities that may or may not have seemed particularly smart at that time. But when you start to look at it from the perspective of reproducing those abilities in robots, no one has come close.  And those capabilities are shared with humans and can be mapped to higher-level abilities.<p>For example, start with the advanced vision and motor systems that work together in the average house cat.  Add in the ability to communicate and coerce humans into providing fresh food and water at will (ok, my cat was spoiled).  The desire and ability of the cat to play in a slightly creative way -- my cat would look at me, arch her back, puff up her tail, tilt her head, as a clear communication that she wanted me to play chase with her.

Common platforms are needed or convenient.  Right now these platforms are generally controlled by large companies with something approaching monopolies in various markets.  For example, Amazon provides services and a destination that help people sell things.  The problem is Amazon is a company that also sells things and is trying to maximize profits.  So vendors are competing with the company running their vending platform.<p>Uber provides a platform for people to make money with their cars and to get around.  It has the large network that drivers and riders need.  But they are also so dominant that there is very little competition and so they can price things unfairly.<p>My belief is that A) we do need common platforms but B) the monopoly platforms are unfair and C) decentralized technologies can provide common platforms that aren&#x27;t controlled by monopolies.<p>So what I think would make sense would be for drivers or even self-driving car companies to use decentralized protocols to make one large network and platform.  That platform is open source and decentralized and used by many competing companies that want to provide transportation services.  This allows companies access to a large pool of drivers and riders and a core technology implementation, but does not relinquish control to one company, so we can preserve competition and fairness.", "time": 1535232627, "type": "comment"}

Perhaps if you could combine it with an interactive system that converts text to schemas.<p>For example, say you had a way (a skill?) to convert a schema to a web form.  Then the AI would need to handle speech-to-schema-change such as &quot;add a field for Middle Name&quot;.  Then perhaps there is a skill to go from the web form to a save data request and another to accept the request and another to update the database schema etc.<p>But the AI might come more in handy for interpreting more complex schemas such as nesting, grouping or workflow etc.<p>But besides an advanced domain specific AI it seems like this foundation of parsing, schemas and transformations would be a good start for speech-based or other higher level program generation tools. I can envision a web page that generates a CRUD application from mobile front end to Firebase back end and then spits out the code that you can then add more advanced features to.<p>So it seems a smart strategy to embrace open source because that can allow other developers to add mappings that you can leverage for your own app or program generation tools which you can sell.<p>To me the interactive web-based CRUD application generator is low hanging fruit but more interesting would be to combine your tech with a Google Duplex style interactive speech based AI programmer front end.

However, for each of these problems, there are successful projects addressing them.  Things like capsule networks (Hinton), distributed training on shared experience (Deep Mind), fast online learning with time-based animal-like networks (Ogma).<p>At the same time, the advanced neural network researchers have become familiar with the existing body of AGI work.  They are building their networks into virtually embodied or real-bodied robots that have fully general inputs and outputs and training them in varied environments.<p>Some generality has already been demonstrated.  Based on the progress made so far it seems likely abstraction, depth of cognitive ability etc. will be increased as there are more innovations and integration of existing ones.<p>The reason the timeframe is relatively short is because of the exciting progress so far, the number of actual geniuses working on it, massive investments, improvements in hardware, and social expectation.  The world now believes again this is possible which means there is an explosion of people working on it and ultimately those are two of the biggest factors pushing this into reality.<p>If tools are not released by researchers within a few years then I expect someone to release a tool or game online or on Steam etc. with powerful built-in AGI.", "time": 1518285256, "type": "comment"}

I was the original lead developer of this software (with Mindy Tchieu also doing a lot of the front end, and Sasha Stewart working hard on QA along with her other normal Colbert Report job, don&#x27;t know why they weren&#x27;t mentioned in the article).  Rob Dubbin didn&#x27;t code anything on the project by the way, although he does deserve at least as much credit as me for keeping the project going. My current income is below the federal poverty level, but at least this time I have partial ownership of the product&#x2F;company I am building (its automated statistical arbitrage on cryptocurrencies).<p>To answer your question, yes, there are multiple good collaborative code editors out there.  The software was originally based on Etherpad, and after a year or two I switched it over to Etherpad Lite.  I don&#x27;t know if they now are based on something else at this point, I doubt it -- maybe their new &quot;Showrunner&quot; has a different core.  But for something just like that for code, there is this <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;ep_codepad\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;ep_codepad</a>.

We started working on it in 2011.  I consider this to be a cautionary tale for &#x27;freelance&#x27; developers working for startups everywhere (more on this towards the end).<p>I solved most of the key technical challenges that enabled the main Colbert Report writing group to start using the system well before 2015 (I forget when the main group started using it mostly full time, maybe 2014).  We had a lot of problems, but certainly nothing catastrophic every few weeks the way Rob suggested.  One note about this, the first request I made (and I repeated multiple times) to Rob was to hire a professional quality assurance engineer to help with the release process, and this was never done.<p>Some of the key technical challenges that I solved:<p>1) how to make a system for TV writers that works like Etherpad and has a few other features.  This is how the problem was originally described, and I took the most direct approach -- I built a prototype based on Etherpad, which was a Rhino (JS in Java) and Scala program.  (The other sort of &#x27;runner-up&#x27; for developer selection had presented a prototype built from scratch with zero actual collaborative functionality.)<p>2) reverse-engineering the partially text&#x2F;partially binary-based document database for ENPS and creating JavaScript code to read it.<p>3) full-text document search for the script document database (more than 1GB of data) -- there were multiple approaches, one thing that mostly worked was based if I recall on redis and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;natural\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;natural</a>, then later I rebuilt it on Elasticsearch.<p>4) a Google Spreadsheets-like collaborative realtime rundown editor<p>5) outputting script and rundown data as PDFs to match their old print-out format<p>6) how to deploy the software.  I built a single all-inclusive Docker container starting back in January 2014 (they later took it apart, which at the time the component infrastructure for Docker didn&#x27;t make that a good trade off, now is a different situation).<p>There are a few lessons I took from this project:<p>-- if you find yourself working full-time as a &#x27;freelance&#x27; developer for a project for more than a year or two, you are probably going to get screwed.  For the last few years I have been careful to explain up-front that if I work full-time on a project for a significant amount of time then I will need equity.<p>-- be assertive in terms of project management.  Sometimes this is hard to do because freelance developers may not always have stable income and that may make it hard to put your foot down.  There were some core problems with the server administration, lack of resources, and release process that I would have been able to correct if I had more leverage (in terms of savings?) or balls.  The server admin, back-end coding, tech support, and support for front-end was all on me, even after I had taken on another project in order to make ends meet.  I should have insisted on more resources.", "time": 1515544954, "type": "comment"}

There are plenty of more modern alternatives.  The point is though that you have to walk before you can run and you will need to build your skills up over a number of years.<p>Definitely a good idea to down the line refer to actual CS and software engineering curriculum and study books.  But you really don&#x27;t want to rely on individual prescriptions of what to learn or content sources.  You need to learn actively in a self directed way.  So google is an amazing resource.<p>But I would say 3-8 years, depending on what your standard is and the particular person, for normal non geniuses to have a solid set of knowledge and skills for software engineering if they work on it continuously.

For example developing actual important requirements that make business sense and are feasible and selling them to the clients is critical and really tricky.<p>To me most software engineering falls into two broad categories: design and feedback loops.  By feedback loop I mean a continuous process where there is an input and output mediated by some error detection and error correction.  Feedback loops in SE have multiple layers and types.  It starts with the loop between yourself and the stakeholders in the process of analyzing and negotiating the requirements.  This process continues through the initial development and maintenance of the software.<p>Other examples of feedback loops: between you and the compiler doing static checking of your programs syntax, unit testing, integration testing, etc.  Another one: improving your object-oriented&#x2F;functional&#x2F;reactive&#x2F;modular&#x2F;whatever design as it evolves through new features and testing etc.  That is the design process itself is a feedback loop where you come up with an idea for a design, try it out, see where it went wrong or could be improved, and adjust it.<p>Feedback loops and design overlap and interact of course.  You want your design to facilitate the smooth operation of your loops.  For example, if you need certain types of unit or integration tests, you will need to organize your code with that in mind to some degree.", "time": 1513546017, "type": "comment"}

I explain the picture at the bottom of this comment.<p>My take on this is to compare the types of proposed lot layouts in the article where they have three almost normal sized buildings per plot instead of one, with the &quot;tiny house&quot; concept.  If people aren&#x27;t aware, &quot;tiny house&quot; is a really interesting concept that you may want to google.  I would argue the sustainability of tiny homes is more of a plus than a primary reason for most people really, but since people are sustainability-minded and for practical purposes, some of these homes do not have wet toilets and instead have composting toilets.<p>The reason people are going for tiny homes is because of the lack of affordable &quot;normal-size&quot; housing.  So, if people are willing to buy a house that is actually tiny and does not have a flush feature, maybe the next step up is a quite small but not tiny two-story house that has normal features like flush toilets.<p>----------------------------------------------------<p>Details on picture:<p>So I have been thinking for awhile along the lines of the article, but my buildings are two stories, fairly small but not quite &quot;tiny&quot;, and have more space between them, which is explicitly dedicated to something like permaculture in order to be more sustainable.  They are built with space-saving furniture and designed somewhat similarly to tiny-homes, except they have two full floors.<p>As noted in the picture, I am proposing much more living space than is available in tiny homes.<p>The permaculturish part means that the landscaping is designed to produce food.  So the large circles on the picture are dwarf fruit or nut trees, the smaller circles berry and nut bushes (like American filbert for example).  The rectangular strip is something like walking onion or maybe another perennial like yam.  Around the entire property is an artificial raceway stream&#x2F;pond with paddles to keep the water moving.  This artificial stream&#x2F;pond is used to farm a few fish.  There are also one or two chickens on the property to produce eggs.<p>The furniture can be things like wall beds that convert to sofas for downstairs, wall beds that convert to desks for upstairs.  The construction would use SIPs and HRV&#x2F;ERV.  The raceway pond could also have a pipe at the bottom for purposes of geothermal cooling&#x2F;heating for the buildings.  The buildings would have solar panels on the top of course.", "time": 1512202677, "type": "comment"}

Do we generally conclude that these are the most meritorious musical compositions of the moment?  Or are they popular because they happen to be catchy, or just raunchy enough to play on our base desires but not enough to be censored, or because the distributor has a deal to continuously play the song on the radio?<p>QWERTY is still popular mainly just because of momentum.  At the time it came out many decades ago, it had some nice utility.  But clearly the core idea of slowing down typing became outdated long ago.  But when it comes down to it, learning a new keyboard is not easy.<p>To switch to a new way of doing things does not depend on having a better way.  I believe it depends on some type of social networking effects and chance.  For example, if several celebrities suddenly decide to create a Twitter campaign about the evils of QWERTY and incredible qualities of DVORAK, then it for some reason came standard in a new hot electronic device that happened to be trendy among teenagers, perhaps we would see a significant market switch.<p>This is one thing that I have noticed about some posts on HN.  People will come on and say that their startup failed, and then come up with a list of rationalizations blaming various material qualities of their product or service.  In most cases I believe this is quite an incorrect interpretation of events.  They usually have a perfectly good or often superior product, which simply did not catch on.

Its just not branded&#x2F;consumed as VR, i.e. with headsets, and it lacks the open-world customization and connectivity that was assumed in many of the stories.  I believe that is mainly down to limitations with realistic graphics needing to be prebaked and networking issues as well as lack of adoption of peer-to-peer systems like content distribution and payment.<p>I think that eventually we will move back towards the open-world, user-created and maximally immersive metaverse in a huge way.  A few things will make that happen.  One is peer to peer distributed services, which I believe will eventually replace most centralized services.  It will just become the way we do distribute code, content, and money.  Sure, people have been talking about this for many years, but while the adoption and applications haven&#x27;t reached wide popularity, they continue to grow steadily.   This is just as much about social change as it is about technology.  And groups of people change and adapt slowly.<p>Another enabling technology will be real-time path tracing or ray tracing etc.  This will probably be enabled by better hardware and&#x2F;or custom chips designed for global illumination. If we can combine this effectively with procedural generation, that can really reduce the bandwidth requirements and make custom, on-the-fly networked loading of diverse complex realistic environments much more practical.<p>Another thing that will move us back towards those old-school metaverse visions is better VR hardware.  When we have widely available inexpensive high resolution, lightweight, untethered displays and convenient, high-fidelity input devices, VR will become the default computing mode for large numbers of people.  Within a few years those things will come together.<p>One last element of the metaverse stories is AI, which is also advancing quickly.

I will admit that I have worked on several projects where something like this was the case.<p>It may just be that some of the projects I have worked on have not been so great (because it is much easier to get those contracts), or maybe this is common -- but what I have seen is startups or dev teams that are iterating quickly on programs that fundamentally do not work or cause their users great frustration.  Part of the problem is that people often underestimate the technical difficulty (or perhaps almost infeasibility in some cases) of certain features or impracticality of some UX, etc.<p>The user frustration one was a government contract so the users couldn&#x27;t switch to another program.  What happened was we built a program for utility workers that required a ton of data entry in the field.  Due to slow loading screens or just a ton of extraneous fields or an issue of keeping laptops clean or something else, it was impractical, so they switched to doing data entry in the office on based on paper forms.  And then someone decided to give all of those forms to one poor lady in the office.  One day I was permitted to visit, and found that due to some bugs we had not been told about and the sheer volume of work, the lady was literally going insane.  They were still iterating quickly and adding tons of features on that project when I left.<p>Here is an example where a project manager may have been using something like the idea of an imperfect MVP as an incorrect rationale for perhaps not evaluating core functionality carefully enough.  The product was a home server device.  A core feature that was supposedly complete when I came onto the project was a relay&#x2F;proxy system that would allow multiple connections to come into this device through one port while it was behind NAT.  Or something close to that -- it was a few years ago so I don&#x27;t remember perfectly.  But I was initially given the task of working on some lighting animation and only coincidentally discovered that this proxying system and other core networking was not even close to working.  I did eventually get a multiplexing thing working for it but they never delivered the system to the initial customer so it was never fully tested.<p>On another project, it started out as another case of an &#x27;MVP&#x27; that actually didn&#x27;t do the thing it was supposed to do.  It mostly did it most of the time, but due to the nature of the project, without an automatic way to detect and correct the 5% of cases where it didn&#x27;t work, it could not possibly make any significant amount of money.  So when I came on, I wasted quite a bit of time trying to make this supposedly already working MVP work, but it had been &#x27;iterated on quickly&#x27; and had unmaintainable code and no tests, so I ended up rewriting it.", "time": 1506396482, "type": "comment"}

We cannot say for sure that this will happen in the next X years, but there is enough evidence that it is a possibility in X years.  I believe that x is less than 5 years.  I think the likely way we will get there is by creating artificial virtual animals that have high bandwidth sensory and motor outputs, advanced neural networks, and develop diverse skills gradually in varied environments like young animals. Obviously until we actually see those types of systems performing generally, that is speculation.  One of the common beliefs of myself and other &#x27;AGI-believers&#x27; is in exponential growth of technology.

On that type of time scale, whether you believe we will achieve some type of general intelligence in 5 years or even 500, it is a relatively short time.  Even in terms of just human history, those with my type of worldview believe this will develop relatively soon.  This will be a new type of life (or tool).  A higher and much more capable paradigm.  Whether they care enough to have disputes with us or not, humans will only be relevant in the larger scheme so far as they can interface with these things.<p>3.  What most of these people are saying is not &quot;Oh no, AI is dangerous, better stop&quot;.  Generally people who understand this well enough realize this is sort of a force of nature or evolution that cannot be stopped.  What we can try to do, however, is try to guide the development to be more beneficial for us (at least at the beginning stages).  We have to take it seriously because there are enough signs that we have the components to build it that we don&#x27;t _know_ that it won&#x27;t happen soon, and the consequences of an unfriendly or out-of-control AI are too serious.<p>So the idea is, try to come up with some rules to handle this, and that is what governments are supposed to do.  And also try to actively pursue friendly practical AI before someone who is less aware comes up with something we can&#x27;t control.", "time": 1504574216, "type": "comment"}

More generally, it\u2019s the ability to process data from the environment and then act in the environment. The cell really is the start of intelligence, of all organic intelligence, and it\u2019s very much a data processing machinery.\u201d\n&gt; The organic intelligence, he says, confers an embodied model of the world for the conscious organism. \u201cThe data that\u2019s coming in [through the senses] only really matters at the point where it violates something in the model that I\u2019m already predicting.\u201d<p>So I believe that we should be emulating the capabilities of much simpler organisms.  For me I would look at something like a lizard or simple mammal first for a practical starting point, rather than simulating billions of cells and DNA machinery.  But the core aspects of intelligence are right there in the cell as he says -- the embodiment, the complex model, prediction and adaptability.  To me crows are too smart for a starting point.<p>Personally I think that what typically we think of as general intelligence or strong AI is really just a very smart animal (human), but that is mainly a matter of degree of performance rather than a totally different type of intelligence from animals.  What is missing from our computer programs is the type of things that a crow, your cat, or probably even a lizard, all do very naturally.  And we may be able to technically bring that down to worms or the cell even as far as core capabilities (but not practical targets for emulating).<p>Can we build an artificial lizard that is able to process the same high bandwidth stream of sensory data as that animal?  That can output the same high bandwidth stream of motor outputs?  That can see part of a predator behind a rock and realize that it must move, and plan an escape route?  That can do these things in completely arbitrary novel environments?  That can perform that species&#x27; mating dance to attract a mate? These are the types of capabilities I believe we should start with, based on broadly adaptable systems like advanced neural networks.  So I think his artificial life slide is mostly right, but we should aim to just emulate animals as a serious goal, with the types of high bandwidth inputs and outputs and complex environments, and make sure that all of the capabilities he lists on that slide like attention etc. are derived from&#x2F;integrated with powerful general purpose adaptive computation like advanced neural nets so they can handle real world complexity and performance requirements.", "time": 1504383899, "type": "comment"}

The expectation for many is that there will eventually start to be a much more equitable distribution of resources and power towards places like China and&#x2F;or Africa or India. This will mean there is significantly less real wealth for Americans. This, combined with the pressure to increase sustainability, means that the real world economy in the US is either not growing or growing very sluggishly.<p>When the economy is not really growing, our current systems don&#x27;t function well, people start looking to conserve and cooperate rather than compete so much.  A general trend of increasing socialism is good for the US to some degree I believe, but won&#x27;t solve the problems.<p>What we have now are very large technopolies like Amazon, Google and Uber controlling large segments of our economy.

This does give us platforms for efficiency, but the fact that these are centralized organizations means big problems in terms of power distribution and freedom as well as the evolvability of systems.<p>The solution is going to be technical upgrades to our social frameworks.

The idea is that we cannot possibly stop advanced human-like and then human-surpassing AI from developing.  No matter how hard we try to slow down AI development.<p>So when they say that AI can be dangerous, they do not mean that we should try to stop developing AI, since that is impossible.  What they mean is that we should try to mitigate the risks to some degree.  One way, which Musk and others are pursuing, is to try to create strong but friendly AI before some less friendly but equally potent variant becomes dominant.  But if we do not develop some kind of high bandwidth interface with computers and AI that we control, eventually we should expect computer-based intelligence to significantly surpass our capabilities, to the point where we become irrelevant.<p>If you disagree that there is any possibility of strong AI or any existential threat, what harm is there in pursuing strong but friendly AI, or in developing the BCIs (brain-computer interfaces)?  The only &#x27;harm&#x27; I can see is if this gets oversimplified as it has been to the idea of &quot;AIs could be bad, we must stop AI&quot; -- which they are not trying to say.", "time": 1501037361, "type": "comment"}

They are, by necessity, unshakable -- because if your beliefs were easily upset, then your entire understanding of the universe would collapse.<p>One thing that makes this confusing is that many people adopt a belief system based (supposedly, at least) on empiricism and the scientific method.

However, the reality is that, since no one actually does the majority of these experiments themselves, the _supposed_ empirical nature of all of these &#x27;facts&#x27; just plays the same role as faith in religious worldviews -- it is a way to hand-wave away any rebuttal (&#x27;its a scientifically proven fact&#x27;).<p>The other confusing thing is that even though core ideas are basically immune to rationality, people have absolutely no problem whatsoever constructing elaborate rationalizations for their beliefs on top of them.

Perception of reality is actually so different between different groups that this is basically a literally different world you are trying to bring them into.

Basically I keep thinking that the main advantage deep learning has is probably not actually the neural nets, but the fact that they are highly parallel and very general computation techniques.<p>So if it doesn&#x27;t really have to be a NN, maybe there could be a way to more efficiently achieve the same level of results by using something more like evolved parallel programs. Maybe have a universal virtual sensor grounding. Then if you find a useful&#x2F;general procedure&#x2F;dataset you could distribute it to improve lots of diverse agent&#x27;s knowledge&#x2F;skills immediately.<p>But to evolve these supposed universal function-approximating parallel programs that are more efficient and exchangable than deep NNs, you would need something like backpropagation, except for some arbitrary program structures.   So when reading about backpropagation on wikipedia they mention the generalization is <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Automatic_differentiation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Automatic_differentiation</a><p>Anyway I don&#x27;t grock all the details fully but my interpretation of all of this is that I think things like backpropagation with deep NNs are truly general purpose and when combined with grounding such as streams of virtual&#x2F;real senses and training across widely varied tasks can actually produce general human and animal&#x2F;like intelligence.  I think the problem is it just takes a ton of computing power, iterations and time.  If we wait 2-10 years that probably won&#x27;t matter.  But if we don&#x27;t want to wait we can probably do something similar and more efficient&#x2F;readily distributable if we can use algorithms that aren&#x27;t NNs but are general and highly parallel and can  be adjusted via AD to learn.<p>Based on this I personally believe we will see human&#x2F;animal like general intelligence systems before 2020.", "time": 1483058358, "type": "comment"}

That&#x27;s my guess.  The biggest issue is slow learning or requiring quite a bit of data.  If typical artificial neurons aren&#x27;t enough, there are actually some promising advances in spiking neural networks some of which are actually able to perform quite accurately and learn much more quickly.  So that is another possibility.  Can&#x27;t be sure.  I think we should be optimistic that it doesn&#x27;t require too many more major breakthroughs (if any).<p>The reason that I think some (many?) people are sooo skeptical still is that deep down they may believe that the cause or explanation for _animalis_ (animus?) is somehow uniquely human or magic.  What I mean is the thing that makes animals and people seem (or be) alive and conscious.

Consider a lizard.  How many robots do we have that can really emulate the dynamic and lithe behavior and interaction of a lizard? Perhaps none.  Our robots are quite slow and generally have limited freedom of movement.  I bet that if we did a good job of emulating most of the entire complex anatomy of a lizard with some type of robot (including the breathing) (maybe use some type of EAP muscles like <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seas.harvard.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;artificial-muscle-for-soft-robotics-low-voltage-high-hopes\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seas.harvard.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;artificial-muscle-...</a>) and then came of up with a way to train its behavior generation as based on a deep neural network from detailed videos of interactions with human handlers, people would say &quot;that thing is alive&quot; and change their minds about the reality of even human-like AIs in the next few decades.", "time": 1474890952, "type": "comment"}

This could be a large bureaucracy of state-run corporations or just large companies in a primarily capitalistic society that evolve into monopolies over time.<p>It seems in both systems whether they start with the sharing or competing idea that ideology gets diluted by practicalities over time.  Which makes sense because we must be able to cooperate on some level in order to have a holistically functioning society, and we must also be able to compete in order to have some freedom for things to evolve.<p>But also in both systems we have conglomeration and over-aggregation.  My belief is that we have proven that the basic structures are missing some key components that might prevent this from happening.<p>I think that the key is really to improve the basic technology of money and government as it intersects.  To do that we need to examine carefully the underlying assumptions of what money and government are, and take a contemporary approach to improving those systems, employing our high technology.  And as I said, one of the key problems we have with the relatively primitive systems in place is over-centralization.  Capital&#x2F;power accumulates and that makes it hard for the system to adjust to local circumstances, hard to evolve, and even hard to function.<p>So I subscribed to subreddits like r&#x2F;rad_decentralization, r&#x2F;bitcoin, r&#x2F;btc, r&#x2F;ethereum, r&#x2F;polycentriclaw.

I think we need a more sophisticated framework though both on a conceptual level and a technological one.  We should not rely on regulation by decree.  Its as if the World of Warcraft system administrators were not allowed to talk to the developers or even edit data in the system, and could only make announcements about new rules for types of gaming that were not allowed, could only stop people from hacking the system by sending them threatening chat messages or actually getting police to put them in jail.

But after they become say twice as smart, normal humans probably won&#x27;t have as much sway over them anymore.<p>I think that when you look at all of the amazing abilities from the last few years from Watson winning at Jeopardy, Deep Dream, Deep Mind with WaveNet speaking and arcade game learning, Atlas walking and picking up boxes, winning at Go, etc. -- these are all amazing and people are very serious about pursuing general AI again.  So how do we know how many more fundamental breakthroughs are actually required to get to our truly general humanlike intelligence?  Are we even sure that we don&#x27;t have the techniques already and just need to combine them in a certain way?<p>So my way of thinking is that to speculate conservatively, guess that there may be two major research breakthroughs required on the same order as deep learning.  If we had not seen such an increase in AGI research then that would sort of console me.  But because AGI funding has increased and the belief is back that these types of goals are possible, it seems like we should not assume that it will take many decades to achieve these breakthroughs (if we actually need more breakthroughs).  How do we know that one or two of the dozens (hundreds? thousands?) of literal geniuses with an adequate background who are working in this area will not come up with some new major breakthroughs in the next two years or five years or eight?<p>So yes my personal opinion is that we should start planning for an &#x27;alien invasion&#x27; of superintelligent AGI which if we are being cautious could pretty much come at any time now, and certainly it might happen before 2030.", "time": 1473634368, "type": "comment"}

For example, in my American Lit class, there were literally three male students including me.  The funny thing in that class was that at least half of the subject matter was basically about how the white male was evil.<p>But I definitely didn&#x27;t fit in there, even without the subject matter.  And its not that the girls treated me differently, they didn&#x27;t -- but I knew I was different.  Because I was surrounded by girls.<p>So I think that just the fact of the momentum of having lopsided student counts of males versus females has a huge effect.  People do need to fit in and being with people who are really just like them is a big part of that.  I think the stereotypes do have a big impact too, but its a double-whammy -- even when girls might not really be influenced by the stereotype, the reality of being the only female or one of a small group of females surrounded by young men in their classes will make them question their place.<p>So I think the social dynamics have more to do with it than people realize and I think this is a good article.", "time": 1444672721, "type": "comment"}

That doesn&#x27;t mean it has a great design.  One of the very first design decision&#x2F;belief they made was &quot;no code can perform with garbage collection&quot;.  Well, garbage collection does cause quite a few performance problems, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t work if you engineer it right.<p>Personally I think Go and Nim are better languages as a general statement, both for applications and systems programming.<p>I know I am going out on a limb making a negative statement like that, and previously Nim developers have tried to discourage me from saying negative things about Rust.  Those guys are smart and have social skills and they realize they should be careful to be nice to Rust developers because sophisticated developers looking for things like performance, type safety, etc. with a C or C++ background are really going to benefit from Nim if they give it a chance and Rust developers are prime candidates for Nim conversion.<p>So let me just say clearly that I don&#x27;t associate with the main Nim community, the core developers, or anyone really.  Nothing I say here reflects on them I hope.<p>I literally have no friends in fact.<p>I don&#x27;t understand people, or pay much attention to them, or interact with them very much.  When I do interact I say what I really think, not what people want to hear.<p>What I DO understand is technology.  From a very early age I have been programming in everything from different types of assembly language to C to C++ to Ruby,  Javascript&#x2F;CoffeeScript&#x2F;ES7, different variants of SQL, Rust, Forth, OCaml, etc.<p>Mozilla is a leading technology organization with many contributors.  Rust is a new technology with quite a few people innovating on it.<p>Unfortunately, Rust starts with a bad design decision and never really recovers from that design decision.  The values and perspective are lacking a modern, contemporary perspective.<p>The Rust worldview is trapped in the C++ era.<p>I have been primarily a JavaScript developer both on the front and back end for many years now.  Why?  Because I like to make useful applications and I am sane and paying attention.<p>But in a world where people were better informed and had better judgement and the best things won out rather than the most popular, Rust would be an obscure language being toyed with by a few academics for (perhaps?) implementing certain parts of kernels, the new browser from Mozilla would be fully peer-to-peer capable (using IPFS&#x2F;gittorrent&#x2F;swarm&#x2F;ndn etc), written in Nim of course, use JIT&#x2F;VM&#x2F;something Nim for scripting, and have thrown out JavaScript&#x2F;ES6&#x2F;ES7 AND CSS for good.  Of course, in this ideal world there would be no google monopolizing all advertizing and capturing most good engineering talent, since semantic markup and p2p query would also be be built in to this browser, making google irrelevant.  The default mode for the browser would be virtual reality, with the ability to render 2d operating systems or markdown&#x2F;images on arbitrary 3d surfaces.<p>But instead we have the world we have.  All advertising must follow the dictates of a giant all-powerful global corporation.  Mozilla is trapped in a pseudo-C++ mindset and spending most of its efforts trying to reproduce the intractable mess of decades of CSS hacks, in the time the engineers have left after going through in excruciating detail all of the possible ways to &#x27;borrow&#x27; memory.  CSS, a brilliant system that is a pain the in the ass not only for programmers but also designers, so complex that only two computer programs in the world are known to do a reasonable job of rendering it accurately.<p>Its time to stop dragging the old tools, mindsets, and technical debt forward.  Stop judging things on the basis of momentum or authority (Google&#x2F;Mozilla&#x2F;Microsoft) and start using your brain to select things rationally.<p>Mozilla as an organization is not going to be capable of admitting they made a mistake with Servo&#x2F;Rust and recoding it in Nim.  Just like the world is not going to accept that we should throw out CSS and use any other simple system that can reproduce graphic designs.  And we are not getting rid of JavaScript with its horrible threading model and garbage collection anytime.  But we should.

This is essentially blaming the victim, and often absolutely incorrect.<p>My personal anecdotes relating to this are as follows.  I have had serious acid reflux for years.  It is generally the &quot;silent&quot; type and one of the main symptoms I have is asthma, especially night-time or sleeping-time asthma, triggered by the reflux.<p>I have tried various diets, including abstaining from caffeine, anything that could possibly contain wheat or trigger a wheat sensitivity, Atkins, fasting.  None of those changes make my acid reflux or other related symptoms go away.  I have also done experiments with strictly reducing my intake of food and drinks after certain times of day.  This was also ineffective.<p>What does seem to help, to some limited degree, is taking large doses of acid reducer pills, and staying as upright as possible while sleeping.<p>Also, when I had a TIF surgery to repair my minor hernia and supposedly eliminate the reflux, it was significantly reduced, but never went away completely.

Right now for the web, that is HTTP APIs.<p>There is a pretty powerful religion pushing &quot;true REST&quot;, i.e. emphasis on using the correct HTTP verb in the proper way in relation to the type of entity being updated.<p>To me, that is enforcing a very basic general (CRUD) type of knowledge representation for the programmed web.  I think it demonstrates that the instinct for a common language is there.<p>You can also see serious KR use in certain domains like biomedicine.<p>One area I have been thinking about applying KR is in defining information systems and programming languages.  The reason I want to do that is because there seems to be quite a lot of overlap between a very diverse set of programming languages, and also because I want a format to be able to represent algorithms that can serve as a basis for a type of open source operating system.  This operating system either needs to force everyone to produce code for a certain programming language or common lower-level virtual machine.  OR: it can use a higher-level semantic metalanguage (maybe based on description logics) and then people can program that in the language they choose (perhaps something most suited to a particular system or domain).<p>All of these are programmer use cases.  I think more and more of this general purpose type of knowledge representation will inevitably start being applied by programmers.<p>One key reason we don&#x27;t see it applied more often I believe is convenience.  You need a convenient representation and convenient tooling.  Most of the semantic web or more generally KR tools haven&#x27;t focused on that enough, which is understandable because the core requirement is machine-processable exchange.  I think the trick might be coming up with a way to embed a compact KR more directly in general purpose programming languages or data formats, or translate automatically to and from domain representations to a KR format.<p>Another idea I had besides building an operating system on top of a DL (translated to and from different programming languages or representations, serving as a common metalanguage) was to try to popularize semantic computing at the same time as you popularize a standard for the metaverse.  <a href=\"https://github.com/runvnc/vr\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;runvnc&#x2F;vr</a>", "time": 1414335294, "type": "comment"}

For now that means things like hydroponics and aquaponics.  In the future that could be more sophisticated biotechnology or nanotechnology of some sort.<p>Its sort of a localization and distribution mindset.<p>One basic idea is that if food is produced far away, as it is often produced hundred or thousands of miles away, some energy must be expended to transport it.  So if a tomato grows hydroponically in the corner of the room, the distance it needs to travel to my mouth in order for me to eat it may be say 10 feet.  If it grows in the ground 500 miles away, it would need to travel 500 miles (plus 10 feet).  Certainly the energy required to move a tomato 500 miles is greater than zero.  Add that up for everything you eat, and there is a fair amount of inefficiency.<p>Another idea is that producing food or other needs locally means less dependence on more centralized control and distribution systems, which means more security for individuals and families.  Its sort of like extending the idea of solar panels and 3d printing.  If we can get our own energy from the sun, and print out our own products, why do we have to go to the store to buy food that was grown 400 or 4000 miles away?", "time": 1411265270, "type": "comment"}

This would be more efficient and save on energy and other costs needed for transporting and retailing food.<p>These things will probably become more economically viable and popular as solar becomes a consumer-level reality.  As in, people are buying solar kits at Walmart or Home Depot regularly.  The prices are almost already there.<p>Pretty sure that a lot of this is related to network effects and trends.  The neighborhood urban hydroponic farming thing becomes more economically viable as it becomes more popular, simply because more people are cooperating (via the market) in order to make that more convenient.<p>Of course, there is a limit to how much food we can produce locally.  Right now, even if we converted every Target into an urban farm, and every home and apartment used advanced technology to pull in solar energy efficiently and dedicated a full 1&#x2F;3 of its space to hydroponic or aquaponic produce, we might only be able to supply a fraction of our food needs that way.

{"by": "ilaksh", "id": 8058087, "parent": 8056978, "text": "This chart is deceptive because it focuses on details of micro relationships while ignoring alignment of factions with global powers vying for control over resources and political influence, which has been stirring this pot on and off for thousands of years.<p>The western media portrays these battles as isolated internal disputes, and while there are very serious regional disputes, they are influenced by external powers like the US and Russia.  Similar to the way in previous epochs groups like Muslim or Roman empires affected outcomes or took advantage of regional conflicts.<p>It is a crucible.  I believe that the biggest driver is still fossil fuels.  Yes, solar and other systems are rapidly replacing a portion of the energy demand, but still, the critical need for oil cannot be understated.  See <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_consumption\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_oil_consum...</a>.  You can see that this is quite an unequal distribution.  The need to maintain that is what puts pressure on that region and causes regional animosities to be taken advantage of in order to move power over to groups siding with dominant forces.<p>Even though solar and other energy sources are gaining ground, the industrial reliance on fossil fuels is a much tougher nut to crack, and I actually believe that creating viable industrial production processes based on bio-fuels or significantly different chemistry is the key to &#x27;peace in the Middle East&#x27;.  Obviously, bad blood between groups going back thousands of years does not go away just because someone invented a non-fossil-fuel-based industrial precursor, but the motivation for stirring up those conflicts in order to further political power of one group gets reduced.<p>There are other aspects to this aside from fossil fuels.  The fire for the crucible is fueled generally by the global power struggle which has other aspects like currency domination.  See <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_hegemony\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Monetary_hegemony</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Great_Game\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_New_Great_Game</a>.<p>For some people, for example, those who read western media which is full of talk of local &quot;evil dictators&quot; and &quot;terrorists&quot;, framing things this way will be very controversial.  My next paragraph will probably be even more controversial for everyone.<p>I believe that hegemony and centralized control (at least on a physical regional level) could someday be supplanted by global cyber-states.  In other words, the borders are not dictated so much by the map or actual physical areas, but by alignments with global systems of political power and organization, connected by internets.  There will likely be multiple internets controlled by different global factions, since controlling these internets is key to controlling the global organizations.<p>Technologies like advanced 3d printing (eventually moving into the area of programmable matter), and free information flow may democratize force so that power over life and death, and therefore ultimate political control, moves from central authorities into the hands of individuals and more regional groups.  At the same time, this type of technology could enable the global super-cyberstates as it would enable any group with sufficient control of a net to nearly instantly muster military assets at any point around the world.<p>I can go so far as to frame all of this as a need for good tools and systems for knowledge management and securing human needs, with the two interacting.<p>One of the core problems for knowledge management systems is how to promote an efficient, integrated, holistic view of the system, while still providing a strong capability for the evolution and maintenance of divergent branches or systems which evolve in new and beneficial directions.  Or just, divergent branches which allow localized freedom in the knowledge graph, which may later lead in beneficial directions.<p>An example of this is different standards or platforms competing for dominance in technology.  Based on a certain platform of solutions and set of common assumptions, a set of new problems arises, and many different groups and individuals solve those problems in relative isolation.  In order to move on to solving the next set of problems, or for the overall group to gain the advantages of the new solutions in a way that integrates with previous efforts, a certain solution set is selected.<p>The particular process by which solutions are selected and integrated into the system, or multiple interacting systems, affects everyone working towards the advancement or maintenance of the systems greatly.<p>Github is a concrete example of this.<p>There seems to be a tendency towards a very small number of systems which exhibit high coupling and low cohesion.  But maybe that view is too mechanistic and low-level, and a higher level view which better incorporates abstraction has a different problem.<p>Creating an abstraction prunes redundant solutions but also often discards less generally relevant information that may however be important in certain circumstances.  Abstractions are powerful because their hierarchical structure allows individual nodes to leverage aggregate powers of branches.  This hierarchical structure is also a disadvantage though in terms of the reliance that leaves have on the integrity of each branch.<p>Compositional rather than hierarchical structures can provide the same power of abstraction without the brittleness and central-point-of-failure that hierarchies have.<p>It seems though that more compositional networked structures tend to converge towards what are effectively hierarchies.<p>Anyway, I think that there must be some tools or processes or perspectives that would provide for somehow more optimal evolutions of structures.  Probably some that are not discovered or in common use.  In case anyone read all of this and knows of some relevant links, please let me know.", "time": 1405790482, "type": "comment"}

Using the first method, I cannot call myself a programmer (some may argue this, but the general impression most programmers will get, perhaps unfortunately, is that I did not do programming and am not a programmer).

First of all, a panic attack is not like ordinary anxiety.  Getting nervous ahead of a meeting is not a panic attack.  Sure sometimes people can get extremely nervous and have a panic attack at times like that, but people can also have a panic attack that seems to come out of the blue.  So there are different causes and variations on panic attacks that people here seem to not be comprehending.  There can be a number of completely physical rather than mental health issues that can cause panic attacks.  Especially if you start getting panic attacks without a history of anxiety you need to carefully rule out those physical causes before you assume that you just need to meditate more or get CBT or something.  And even if the cause is mental or psychological there are different types of panic attacks so CBT etc may not be effective and you or your friend may really need medication.  Anyway just because you have gotten really nervous a few times don&#x27;t assume that you understand someones condition well enough to give them medical advice especially if its to tell them to just meditate or somrthing.", "time": 1400895181, "type": "comment"}

As evidenced by the powerful tools cited in this article that address various aspects of the &quot;programming&quot; problem, there have been numerous efforts to move the state-of-the-art in software development forward.  And to a great degree those efforts have _proven_ quite a few superior paradigms.<p>And yet, we haven&#x27;t seen those new paradigms become truly mainstream for most programmers.  Why?  I do NOT believe it is because the approaches haven&#x27;t integrated the right new concepts, because there are so many existing useful tools combining many different new ideas effectively which have failed to become mainstream among programmers.<p>I think many of those new approaches could and should have become normal operating mode for programmers.<p>I think the reason they did not is this: <i></i>the core definition of &quot;programming&quot; (and by extension &quot;software engineering&quot; etc.) is an antagonistic and largely manual process of creating complex textual source code that can be used to describe system behavior.  Period.<i></i><p>For example, if I want to call myself a web &quot;developer&quot; I DARE NOT use an interactive GUI tool to generate and maintain the source code for my web site.  Web developers will always say, for example, they avoid this because the source code generated that way is less maintainable by hand.  In many cases that may be true.  In some cases with advanced code generation it is not.  Regardless, I don&#x27;t believe that is the actual reason.  Its just a rationalization.<p>What do we call someone who&#x27;s entire job entails creating a web page using a graphical user interface?  In other words, this is a hypothetical person who has found a hypothetical GUI tool that can accommodate all of his web site design and implementation needs without any manual edits to source code.  If he builds a web site or web application this way, and writes zero lines of code, do we refer to him as a very smart and advanced web &quot;developer&quot;?  Or do we call him a web designer or simply a WordPress user (for example)?<p>We do NOT refer to him as a web &quot;developer&quot;.  He has no right to refer to himself as a &quot;developer&quot; or &quot;programmer&quot; because <i></i>he has not wrestled through an antagonistic manual process to create complex textual source code<i></i>.  And that&#x27;s what people are not understanding.  The reason we don&#x27;t call him a programmer is NOT because he didn&#x27;t create an effective program or website.  Its because the way he did it wasn&#x27;t hard enough and doesn&#x27;t match our outdated definition of what &quot;programming&quot; is.<p>To create a POPULAR system (among &quot;real&quot; &quot;programmers&quot;) that makes programming more practical or easier using new paradigms, you must either redefine programming to include the possibility of new paradigms and a non-antagonistic process, or perhaps somehow trick programmers into thinking what they are doing is actually harder than it is.  Maybe if there are a few places to type a command to generate source code, that will be sufficiently complex to still be considered &quot;programming&quot;.<p>If you are too successful without doing those things then you will just have another tool that only &quot;users&quot; or &quot;beginners&quot; would ever admit to using.", "time": 1400377527, "type": "comment"}

And some others I better not mention.  Last few years I have mostly been enjoying dynamic languages and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to declare types.<p>I have been doing programming mainly with ToffeeScript in Node.js recently.  I was worried that I might find dealing with some types and an actual compiler for a static language to be burdensome.<p>With Nimrod I have a syntax that&#x27;s even cleaner than ToffeeScript and Python, which includes types inference to make type declarations minimal, and I actually find it easier to program with the type checking at compile time.  Also my code is being compiled to C and then to native so it is very fast.<p>And it has very powerful standard library.<p>So what I have found is that not only does my Nimrod code execute vastly faster with much less memory than Node.js code, it builds much more quickly, and it is easier to read and maintain the code.  One aspect of this is the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use namespace qualifiers when you use module calls.  Initially I was worried about that, since it is such a significant characteristic of Node.js code and point of pride for some.  However, I think Nimrod has proven that this is the way to go.  I can easily create my own DSLs with modules and extend the base programming system.  This is something I tried to do with CoffeeScript because DSLs are powerful, but it was impossible to do it elegantly.<p>I have not yet attempted to learn the metaprogramming features, but from what I can see, few, if any, other languages with such high performance and clean syntax can compare with Nimrod in terms of metaprogramming.<p>I am quite glad that I found out about Nimrod before I got too caught up in Go or Rust.  The syntax is much cleaner than Go, and the performance is better.  The syntax is _much_ much cleaner than Rust, and overall its a much more practical language.<p>What I am doing now and plan to continue doing as much as possible, is moving my web programming into Nimrod code.  Basically I am doing this because I need less memory usage in an agent I am going to install for a service.  I briefly considered using C or something like that, quickly decided to take advantage of a newer language, started looking at Go, briefly got excited about Rust, saw Nimrod and fell in love.  This is the language that is going to make it most practical to achieve my goals, as well as allow me to stay engaged by learning its more in-depth features as time goes on.<p>The only reason that Nimrod doesn&#x27;t have instant uptake and popularity is that people don&#x27;t evaluate things logically.  Most people aren&#x27;t capable of it, but even among the ones that are, peer pressure generally takes over.  Humans are herd animals.  They follow the crowd.  If most people are driving cars that are four times as large as needed every day to work when they could just sign on to the internet and save gas, time, and the planet, then most people will do that, no matter how horrible it is.  If most people choose a particular programming language even though it is inferior, then most other people are going to do that as well.<p>But you can still be like the smart guy who was driving the small, efficient, fast electric vehicle before electric vehicles were cool.", "time": 1394679292, "type": "comment"}

{"by": "ilaksh", "id": 7241750, "kids": [7242209], "parent": 7240894, "text": "I&#x27;m 36 and I have been programming since I was 8.  I&#x27;m not a genius but I have above average intelligence and I am a decent programmer.  My interpretation is that Terry Sutton actually is a good programmer who has more common sense than the average programmer.<p>Practically speaking, it _is_ easier to do most things in WordPress, because there are plugins with nice user interfaces for a large portion of ordinary web application requirements.<p>This is an interesting article because Terry&#x27;s journey and conclusions, for me, are actually a good indication of the direction that software development is going and what the new definition of a good &quot;programmer&quot; will be.<p>And the article hints at a very significant problem in software development today: the fact that the definition of &quot;programmer&quot; or &quot;software engineer&quot; is very much tied in with producing and consuming cryptic and complex ASCII-based source code.  In fact, for many, (although not all), the ability to identify as a programmer is based on how far removed the implementation is from ordinary language, interactions, or business requirements.  Or simply how difficult the implementation is to produce.<p>As more and more interactive graphical tools, powerful and yet easier-to-use and understand programming languages, better adoption of componentization (for example in the web space), adoption of knowledge representation as a basis of language&#x2F;systems frameworks&#x2F;protocols as well as projection editing, coding-by-example and coding assisted by artificial general intelligence, become popular and mainstream (for example, with the vast catalog of WordPress plugins, widgets, and themes available, it should be possible to build an AI system (user-directed incremental interactive narrow AI, not strong AI) that can handle about 70% of web application requirements for many small-to-medium sized business), people will eventually start to pick on the fact that systems that are more difficult to use are not inherently superior or more sophisticated.  And they will realize that the value of a good programmer is not in his ability to produce or consume the most cryptic source code, but in his ability to solve problems using tools.<p>However, since I do identify myself as a programmer, which is still unfortunately tied in with the whole source code thing, and I hope that Terry will also reconsider his own self-identification as a programmer, I have some thoughts for anyone who has feelings that are similar to Terry&#x27;s in regards to the types of systems he evaluated.<p>First, its very true, there is no endpoint.  You cannot possibly master even a tiny subset of the popular systems out there, and they never stop inventing new ones with more and more layers.  I think there are quite a few people out there that misunderstand this whole thing though in relation to what programmers are supposed to be capable of or do.  You are not supposed to be a master anymore.  You are not supposed to remember how to do everything off the top of your head.  You are not supposed to spend 3 months reading a Rails book and then remember everything important about Rails.<p>What a good programmer does with a new technology is take an hour, or a day, or a week, or _maybe_ a few weeks mostly reading about something, and then paste some code in from an example and start experimenting with the system until he understands some basics of how it works.  And then when he needs to add new features, you don&#x27;t go buy and read another book.  You go to Google and type &quot;how do I do XXX with system YYY&quot; and you get example code on Stack Overflow from three different people, pick the one with the most upvotes, adapt it to your code, and try it out.<p>And a good programmer is always looking for tools, programming languages, or whatever that makes his job easier.  Because these days there is so much open source software, its really wasteful to not be taking advantage of these things.  But with that mindset, what I said in the above paragraph is just the only practical way to go about things.<p>And you have to pick your battles, and you have to be willing to drop a technology after trying it out and realizing that its more difficult to use than something else, even if that technology is very popular.  Because popularity is not the same as merit. Its very far from it.  Often, by the time something finally becomes popular, its already quite outdated.  And that is doubly the case for high technology, which evolves as quickly as people can think and type it in.  And it can mean that an entire paradigm, which is extremely popular and considered a best practice, is also out of date.<p>As far as PHP, you&#x27;re right, its usually easier to use WordPress.  But you can still write an occasional plugin, or adapt an existing one, using your PHP skills.  Or just configure and integrate existing WP plugins to solve a problem.  I believe we need to extend our definition of what a programmer is.<p>As far as JavaScript, first, I have done quite a lot of programming in JavaScript.  And I can say quite conclusively that JavaScript is a pain in the ass.  I have also done a fair amount of programming with Backbone.  And I can say conclusively that Backbone is a pain in the ass.<p>However, people looked at the issues with JavaScript and made it better.  And now we have CoffeeScript.  And then a genius in China figured out how to make callbacks in CoffeeScript go away and we got ToffeeScript.<p>And people looked at how to make things more convenient than traditional MVC in JavaScript and came up with AngularJS.  I have done a fair amount of coding in AngularJS.  It is much better both in terms of sophistication, software engineering, ease-of-use, features, etc. than Backbone.js.  Now, many people are confused about that because they think that since Backbone.js is seems more complicated at first glance, it must be better.  That goes back to some fundamental problems with the definition of programming.<p>However, one thing that is a pain in the ass with AngularJS is components.  I.E., defining your own custom elements.  Now we have a new thing called Web Components, using the Polymer system, which makes it much more convenient to create custom elements.  So that is what I am going to use.  Note that even though I used Angular in a couple of projects extensively, I never bothered to become a master.  And now I am going to use Web Components instead.  Because its a better paradigm.<p>But the thing to notice is that the technologies I am recommending are easier-to-use and understand and require less code than the technologies they are replacing.  The direction we are going is to less and less code, especially less and less being written custom to an application.  The direction we are going is for more and more systems to resemble WordPress.<p>As far as Rails goes, no you don&#x27;t have to learn Rails.  So what if it is popular?  It is complicated, and now even more complicated than it used to be.  And remember, popular != good.  Sinatra is an awesome way to approach many types of applications.  Speaking of Sinatra, if you want a cool technology to play with, checkout Jester, written in the new programming language Nimrod: <a href=\"https://github.com/dom96/jester\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dom96&#x2F;jester</a>  You can write code that looks just like Ruby&#x2F;Sinatra, but runs maybe 10 or 100x faster, since it is compiled to C and then to native code.<p>As far as that ImagesLoaded plugin, I think that is RequireJS or something.  And that is one that I have avoided, because the complexity of defining components just hasn&#x27;t been worthwhile.  Compare that to using Browserify with require and exports.   Or just using a script tag.  Much simpler.  And that particular example of that plugin code is a good example of why you don&#x27;t necessarily want to use that.  Again, just because something is popular, doesn&#x27;t mean its better, and doesn&#x27;t mean you have to use it.  That ImagesLoaded plugin is bad code, and its mostly boilerplatey plumbing.  Its not good software engineering as far as I am concerned, because making things less difficult to understand is very important.  A lot of times what becomes popular is just the most complicated thing, either because people confuse complicated with good, or they add on to a simple tool and eventually make it too complicated.<p>So Terry, you&#x27;re a good programmer.  And if something seems a bit more complicated than you are willing to get in for, maybe it _is_ too complicated.  And if you know  how to and are willing to use tools to solve your problems without writing code, that doesn&#x27;t make you a non-programmer.  That just makes you a sane programmer with good common sense.", "time": 1392420101, "type": "comment"}

I believe that we are going to start using that type of system more and more and eventually we will lose things like the HTTP layer.  This may be combined with some of the technologies related to cryptocurrency.<p>For an example of why we are moving to named data networking, take a look at well.. just about any web application that wants to scale.  For example the npm registry.  Also consider the issues around privacy with Facebook and the NSA, and the ability for governments to censor or take down web sites or domains.<p>So any technologies that facilitate things like that, such as more traditional clustered SQL or NoSQL tools, or especially protocols and systems specifically designed for named data networking, will be very powerful.  I like the idea of heterogeneous peer nodes that have everything they need built in and can connect to the network on their own.<p>Another area that is really going to be key is artificial general intelligence.  Notice I did not say machine learning.  I think look at taking advantage of built deep learning systems like the one IBM has with Watson.

But most practically for the next few years IBM and Google&#x27;s (when Google releases it) cloud AIs are going to be game changing for many industries and harnessing them in software will be very useful.<p>Qualcomm&#x2F;Brain Corporation and some others also have some neuromorphic chip technologies that could be extremely useful.<p>Any system that really takes advantage of next gen VR devices like Oculus Rift is going to be interesting.", "time": 1392039408, "type": "comment"}

So I have not been able to show up on time and put in the hours or had the energy to hold a regular full time job.  Being able to work from home on my own schedule has been necessary.<p>At the moment I have a bit of freelance work that is not from those sites and pays OK.  But I may end up going back on odesk or something and scrambling for another project out of necessity.<p>There is a reason those projects are posted on outsourcing sites, which is that the resources available are very limited or at least too limited to pay for US based developers.<p>This initial underfunding usually doesn&#x27;t bode well for the overall project management.<p>Well let me soften that a bit.  Usually the project managers are not completely clueless and are doing the best they can in a situation that is not ideal.  That&#x27;s not always the case.<p>The other developers I have worked with have been very capable contrary to what people say about outsourcing.  But more often than not delivering some kind of usable system is required even though there isn&#x27;t adequate time or developer resources and is never any QA.  So you pretty much have to cut corners everywhere or just lose the fee and get a bad report on your record.<p>The thing is that so many people want custom software and development is so expensive that tools like WordPress with plugins etc are taking the place of custom development.  Sometimes taking advantage of those tools can make what would be completely ridiculous underfunded projects a few years ago now realistic.<p>I think that is great, but we are actually going to have to change our societal structure because there really aren&#x27;t going to be enough jobs.<p>Within 10 or 20 years quite a lot of the application&#x2F;plugin configuration work now being done by programmers and even much of the custom software development will be done by interactive AI programs.<p>The reason I can say that confidently is that we have such a rich ecosystem of for example open source web applications and plugins that have already been developed.  More than half of all software projects are minor improvements in areas where problems have been solved dozens or hundreds of times. With such an ecosystem of existing solutions and most problems already solved the level of language understanding or general intelligence required is low and either already accomplished or will be within our reach shortly.  And to be clear I&#x27;m not just talking about outsourced programming but software development in general.  Certainly there are lots of software projects that require true human level intelligence, but the majority of them do not if we take advantage of existing solutions and employ leading-edge AI.", "time": 1389492069, "type": "comment"}

They wanted to know what I did and wanted details of my vacation.  When I told them I was a software engineer they seemed to not believe me and asked for more details about what a software engineer does.  Basically seemed to be accusing me of being a drug dealer or something.<p>I became angry.  I think because I was angry they decided to demand the name of the company I worked for and the name of my manager.  I also had told them that I was staying with a friend in this other country and they demanded that I give them her name as well.  It seemed to me that unless I gave them this information I would not be allowed to board the plane.  Even when they pulled the contract out of my bag that had the same company name I had given them they did not apologize.  I really hope they did not contact my boss who is the CTO of the company.  I know they did not contact my friend.  Regardless getting a call from DHS about me could have affected the relationship with this company.<p>It seemed that basically I was being held back and questioned because I was angry and not submissive.  It was not until I made a few statements that were more submissive and actually pleading that I was allowed to go.<p>I was the last person to board the jet.  The actual flight which was something like 12 hours and then a stop and another 7 hours was actually fairly enjoyable for me.

It is available on the internet.<p>There seem to be quite a few people who still think that software engineering is about planning, creating design documents or sequence diagrams, building the ultimate design, etc.  Although planning and design are important, this general viewpoint is outdated.<p>I believe the the keys to software engineering, rather than coming up with the ultimate plan or design ahead of time, are A) separation of concerns, and B) tight, closed, feedback loops with incremental improvement.  Your tools and processes are going to embody the core engineering principles.<p>As far as separation of concerns, there are many ways to do that well and to do that poorly.  But I believe that currently Node.js with its simple, one-purpose per module system with semantic versioning gives you the best head start in that direction.<p>Another core feedback loop for contemporary software engineering is automated testing: unit tests, integration tests.  Unit tests keep the loop tight.<p>Continuous integration is also key and can be thought of as a way of making sure you have a closed loop because it means that all of your tests _have_ to pass before you deploy which means that you must immediately make corrections when you have failing tests.<p>Another critical aspect of contemporary software engineering is quickly incorporating feedback from users and other stakeholders.<p>So short iterations are very important.  However, you can&#x27;t just take a few pieces of this whole thing that you like and ignore the rest.  If you do short iterations without good testing, you will be screwed.  You need the whole process to fit together.  That is one way that a lot of &#x27;agile&#x27; teams go wrong-- the manager thinks &#x27;agile&#x27; just means he can release more often using basically the same process and tools he was using before.<p>I believe that the most important aspects of software engineering are the most recent developments in tools and processes and these are often not yet incorporated into many university courses or majors in software engineering.<p>So anyway, just google for the names of the popular build, test, and CI tools are for your platform and also learn about whatever abstractions and component systems are available for your platform.

I started learning SQL, C, C++, memory management etc. many years ago when I was a teenager.<p>However, and I know that people will take the opportunity to disrespect me for this, but I realized, after playing around with 3d C++ graphics in college, that I wanted to build interactive desktop applications quickly.  So I learned to use a very powerful tool called Visual Basic 6.  Not because I didn't understand memory management or anything else, but because it was a better software engineering decision for most projects since it allowed me to not repeat solving the same problems that had already been solved.<p>I know people aren't going to be able to understand this because of the reputation that Visual Basic has, and they will lose respect for me, but I am going to go ahead and say it anyway.  Visual Basic 6 was and still is a better software engineering tool than C++.  Why?  One of the core principles of software engineering is DRY.  Manual memory management means you are repeating yourself.  It also means you are doing the memory management yourself rather than letting the computer do it for you.  Another reason why Visual Basic 6 is superior software engineering over C or C++ is the component models.<p>I eventually moved on to .NET and C# because of the stigma of VB and also because the new frameworks provided better tools.<p>Eventually I realized that the closed source world of desktop Microsoft development was outdated since it was tied to one platform and old-fashioned business models.  So I moved into web development.  The most practical tool for web development was PHP.  It was the best software engineering decision to select PHP to build a web application.  Because it allowed me to avoid solving the same problems that many other engineers had already been faced with and solved on their own.  Something that many software engineers don't understand is that not only is it important not to repeat yourself in your own code, but not to repeat solving the same problems other people have already solved for you.<p>So then I wanted to build a realtime interactive collaborative software application in the web browser.  Because that is the most compelling, useful, and challenging type of application.  So I tried to do it with PHP.  Very awkward.  I tried to use another popular server-side tool, Python.  Again it turned out to be very awkward to do realtime collaborative software applications with Python (using things like Twisted).<p>So when I heard about this thing called Node.js that was built from the ground up to take full advantage of the single-threaded but asynchronous programming model of JavaScript as well as powerful underlying evented non-blocking I/O C libraries, I had to try it.  Guess what?  All of that software engineering done by the people who wrote those C libraries and the people who put together JavaScript and Node means that there are a lot of problems that I don't have to solve to write performant IO-intensive code on the back end!  Continuation-based programming in JavaScript and Node.js just works better and is more maintainable (less code and less complexity) than the other solutions.<p>So I'm sorry, but if you're not adopting new programming languages, tools and frameworks, then I don't think you are a good software engineer.  Because good software engineers only solve the problems that they have to, and don't continue to solve the same problems over and over.<p>Now -- NoSQL.  So, it turns out that NONE of the many software applications I built over the years using Oracle, SQL Server or MySQL actually required 'real' db-level transactions or even involved very large datasets.  And I believe that is the case for most programmers (not all of course).  These days that is still true.  Also, these days I only code in JavaScript (mostly CoffeeScript really).  So when I heard about things like MongoDB that allowed me to store JSON directly, skip the object relational layer, and not even have to define a schema ahead of time, I had to seriously consider whether I needed a normalized relational database, SQL, to constantly \nreiterate joins, etc.  When you examine it logically, it turns out that we were actually doing all of those things just because THAT WAS HOW YOU DID IT.  With the current ecosystem of JavaScript and JSON, it is BAD SOFTWARE ENGINEERING for the MAJORITY of software projects to use a relational database, joins, etc.  Why is it bad software engineering?  Because you are creating a bunch of problems for yourself that you wouldn't have if you used a different set of tools.", "time": 1369694161, "type": "comment"}

Because of the nature of those sites, developers have no choice but to deliver the minimum set of unpolished work that meets only exactly the requirements specified.  The number one reason this is necessary is because any attempts by the developer to clarify various issues unforeseen by the client will generally not be comprehended and will simply be assumed to be 'delaying tactics' preventing the completion of their 'simple task'.<p>So in order for the client to see how complex the task really is and actually come up with new designs, a working system is required.

I will even go so far as to say that desktop machines will start to become identified and have persistent payment systems the same way that mobile devices do.  Because most desktop devices actually are used by only one person and there is a huge convenience win there.<p>You can already see people moving away from desktops and towards laptops.  Or people using their mobile phone almost as if it were a laptop with a tiny screen and slow keyboard.\nYou see people working on the go from coffee shops more and more.<p>With more and more capabilities coming to browser applications, pretty soon people will start to realize that the only important thing that their browser can't do is break out of the confines of the browser tab and create notifications.

By 'instant-on factor' I mean that games can load up very quickly after hitting a URL.  By 'general webiness' I mean, for example, you can start a game at the end of the work day, later the evening continue from your house -- you aren't tied to a particular machine.  Also the web has all of the HTML5 features which could really come in handy for innovative browser-based operating systems or 3d applications.<p>Also, if you take advantage of things like procedurally generated textures and geometry, people won't even have to wait for stuff like loading textures.<p>Asm.js is cool but its not really necessary and not my thing.  We just need good WebGL support.<p>Another feature that 3d browser-based games and applications could take advantage of is WebRTC.<p>The point being that if you take advantage of easy-to-use web APIs and libraries like WebWorkers, WebRTC, Three.js, CopperLicht, web-based languages like CoffeeScript, etc. then the web platform can offer game developers productivity advantages.", "time": 1364413407, "type": "comment"}

We present here a detailed large-scale thalamocortical model based on experimental measures in several mammalian species. The model spans three anatomical scales. (i) It is based on global (white-matter) thalamocortical anatomy obtained by means of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of a human brain. (ii) It includes multiple thalamic nuclei and six-layered cortical microcircuitry based on in vitro labeling and three-dimensional reconstruction of single neurons of cat visual cortex. (iii) It has 22 basic types of neurons with appropriate laminar distribution of their branching dendritic trees. The model simulates one million multicompartmental spiking neurons calibrated to reproduce known types of responses recorded in vitro in rats. It has almost half a billion synapses with appropriate receptor kinetics, short-term plasticity, and long-term dendritic spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (dendritic STDP). The model exhibits behavioral regimes of normal brain activity that were not explicitly built-in but emerged spontaneously as the result of interactions among anatomical and dynamic processes. We describe spontaneous activity, sensitivity to changes in individual neurons, emergence of waves and rhythms, and functional connectivity on different scales.<p><a href=\"http://www.sciencebytes.org/2011/05/03/blueprint-for-the-brain/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sciencebytes.org/2011/05/03/blueprint-for-the-bra...</a><p>Essentials of General Intelligence: The direct path to AGI<p><a href=\"http://www.adaptiveai.com/RealAI_chap_ver2c.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.adaptiveai.com/RealAI_chap_ver2c.htm</a><p>&#62;General intelligence, as described above, demands a number of irreducible features and capabilities. In order to proactively accumulate knowledge from various (and/ or changing) environments, it requires:<p>&#62;1.      Senses to obtain features from \u2018the world\u2019 (virtual or actual),<p>&#62;2.      A coherent means for storing knowledge obtained this way, and<p>&#62;3.      Adaptive output/ actuation mechanisms (both static and dynamic).<p>&#62;Such knowledge also needs to be automatically adjusted and updated on an ongoing basis; new knowledge must be appropriately related to existing data. Furthermore, perceived entities/ patterns must be stored in a way that facilitates concept formation and generalization. An effective way to represent complex feature relationships is through vector encoding (Churchland 1995).<p>&#62;Any practical applications of AGI (and certainly any real-time uses) must inherently be able to process temporal data as patterns in time \u2013 not just as static patterns with a time dimension. Furthermore, AGIs must cope with data from different sense probes (e.g., visual, auditory, and data), and deal with such attributes as: noisy, scalar, unreliable, incomplete, multi-dimensional (both space/ time dimensional, and having a large number of simultaneous features), etc. Fuzzy pattern matching helps deal with pattern variability and noise.<p>&#62;Another essential requirement of general intelligence is to cope with an overabundance of data. Reality presents massively more features and detail than is (contextually) relevant, or that can be usefully processed. This is why the system needs to have some control over what input data is selected for analysis and learning \u2013 both in terms of which data, and also the degree of detail. Senses (\u2018probes\u2019) are needed not only for selection and focus, but also in order to ground concepts \u2013 to give them (reality-based) meaning.<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_temporal_memory\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_temporal_memory</a><p>&#62; A typical HTM network is a tree-shaped hierarchy of levels that are composed of smaller elements called nodes or columns. A single level in the hierarchy is also called a region. Higher hierarchy levels often have fewer nodes and therefore less spacial resolvability. Higher hierarchy levels can reuse patterns learned at the lower levels by combining them to memorize more complex patterns.<p>&#62; Each HTM node has the same basic functionality. In learning and inference modes; sensory data comes into the bottom level nodes. In generation mode; the bottom level nodes output the generated pattern of a given category. The top level usually has a single node that stores the most general categories (concepts) which determine, or are determined by, smaller concepts in the lower levels which are more restricted in time and space. When in inference mode; a node in each level interprets information coming in from its child nodes in the lower level as probabilities of the categories it has in memory.<p>&#62;Each HTM region learns by identifying and memorizing spatial patterns - combinations of input bits that often occur at the same time. It then identifies temporal sequences of spatial patterns that are likely to occur one after another.", "time": 1351827818, "type": "comment"}

Just like in JavaScript where, if you want, you can write all of your code on one line, but you shouldn't.<p><pre><code>    action true\n      option1: 1\n      option2: 2\n</code></pre>\nIf you really use CoffeeScript regularly, that isn't confusing.  I don't usually write it that way though.  I would do this:<p><pre><code>  options =\n    a: 1\n    b: 2\n  action true, options\n</code></pre>\ndoSomething () -&#62;  'hello' just isn't valid code.<p>Usually I would write<p><pre><code>    doSomething -&#62;\n      return 'hello'\n</code></pre>\nor maybe<p><pre><code>    doSomething -&#62; 'hello'\n</code></pre>\nIf you write it the way he did, the parenthesis are confusing.<p>For this one:<p><pre><code>    action = (token, i) -&#62;\n        @tokens.splice i, 0, @generate 'CALL_END', ')', token[2]\n</code></pre>\n-- first of all, you always want to indent two spaces.  But the main problem with that is in CoffeeScript you do need to use parenthesis after the first call because your code will be unreadable otherwise.  You just can't write it the way he did.<p><pre><code>    moveTo 10,\n      20\n      10\n\n    doSomething 1,\n    2\n    3\n    4\n\n    doSomething 1,\n      2\n        3\n       4\n</code></pre>\nThose are ridiculous examples.  No one does that.  You just write moveTo 10, 20, 10<p><pre><code>    doSomething (-&#62;\n    'hello'), 1\n</code></pre>\nIndentation is significant in CoffeeScript, just like it is in Python.  Just having a parenthesis shouldn't change that.  Anyway, what I do is this:<p><pre><code>    somethingDo = (ms, func) -&#62;\n      doSomething func, ms\n</code></pre>\nand then I can just write<p><pre><code>    somethingDo 1, -&#62;\n      'hello'\n\n\n\n    action(key: value, option: value, otherValue)\n</code></pre>\nYou don't write it like that if the function takes two objects.  You would probably just write<p><pre><code>    action {key: value}, {option: value}, otherValue\n\n\n    x = {\n      key1\n      key2\n      key3: value3\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis is called destructuring assignment, and its part of the new ECMAScript.  Its useful to not have to repeat key1, key2 everywhere when the variable with the value has the same name as the object property.  The extra curly braces are just necessary to differentiate from the normal syntax.<p>Sometimes yes/no or on/off are more readable than true/false.  That's an advantage.<p><pre><code>    x = 1 if y != 0;\n</code></pre>\nDon't use semicolons in CoffeeScript.  I also don't put if statements at the end of a line because I don't believe that is very readable for most people including me.  Also, in CoffeeScript its probably better to use isnt instead of !=, although rather than !=, you would want !==.<p><pre><code>    if y isnt 0\n      x = 1\n</code></pre>\nI'm not that sure about the use of unless, although it probably is a little bit more readable overall.<p><pre><code>  break for [tag], i in @tokens when tag isnt 'TERMINATOR'\n  @tokens.splice 0, i if i\n</code></pre>\nHe says that is supposed to delete TERMINATOR from tokens.  I tested it, it doesn't do anything, and the second example of the correct way doesn't work either.  I think he meant this:<p><pre><code>    filtered = []\n    for token, i in tokens\n      if not (i is 0 and token is 'TERMINATOR')\n        filtered.push token\n\n\n    i += block.call this, token, i, tokens while token = tokens[i]\n</code></pre>\nAnother example of something you CAN do in CoffeeScript but shouldn't.  Actually it is a bad idea in general.  I think a CoffeeScript programmer would actually write something like this:<p><pre><code>    class Parser      \n      block: (token) =&#62;         \n        @currentNode.push new Token(token)\n      parse: =&#62;\n        for token in tokens\n          @block token\n        </code></pre>\nI would never write something like 'mainModule.moduleCache and= {}'<p>Instead of<p><pre><code>    js = (parser.parse lexer.tokenize code).compile options\n</code></pre>\nI would write<p><pre><code>    tokens = lexer.tokenize code\n    parsed = parser.parse tokens\n    js = parsed.compile options</code></pre>", "time": 1347912644, "type": "comment"}

CoffeeScript significantly reduces the number of lines of code in a project and therefore the number of defects.<p>CoffeeScript is cleaner and easier to read, which is better software engineering.  CoffeeScript solves many of the issues with JavaScript.  The fewer warts and plumbing people have to deal with related to the language, the more they can focus on the actual problems they wanted to solve.<p>This is a little bit like the architectural decision to program user applications in languages and platforms with garbage collection and built-in frameworks rather than using a language like C or C++ with manual memory management and minimal standard libraries.  Sure you get less control over the lower-level details such as allocation and deallocation of memory, but those lower level details actually are distracting from the application domain and were actually repetitive and could be automated.  So the best way to solve those problems is to move to a platform that abstracts them away or handles them for you.<p>The reason that developers don't like CoffeeScript (other than the fact that they haven't learned it yet, and don't want to take the time) is simple, psychological rather than logical, and its the same reason that they don't like platforms like the ones I was talking about above: it makes things significantly easier, and that is problematic psychologically for programmers for two reasons:<p>1) The whole point of being a programmer is that you are mastering complex ASCII codes that other people can't decipher.  Making things less complex takes away part of your identity as a programmer (not for everyone obviously, but for many).<p>2) Many programmers instinctively and falsely believe that any system which makes their job significantly easier must automatically come with compensatory trade-offs in things like performance or flexibility.  This is intuitive, but false.<p>CoffeeScript improvements: indenting two spaces and using -&#62; plus no closing parens and curly braces makes nested callbacks much easier to read and write, fat arrow binds this making it easier to use classes, class and extends provide a standard, simple way to create and extend classes, iterating over arrays and objects is much easier and cleaner, control flow and function definition is cleaner, better variable scoping, simplified closer wrapper in loops, more straightforward boolean operators, existential operator for cleanly and simply checking for variable existence.<p>Thought of one other explanation for not liking CoffeeScript: plain old status quo bias.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias</a>", "time": 1347571871, "type": "comment"}

I had finished most of my general education requirements.  However, I don't feel as though the general education information was mainly focused on really relevant knowledge or skills.  Some of it was definitely important, but a lot of it was either outdated, not particularly relevant or important, or much further in depth than I needed to go.

And so they just accept that the students will not be able to really learn the material or even understand the hand outs.<p>There is also probably quite a lot of racial tension involved.

For example, if many people knew how to obtain the proper license or whatever and where to go to buy wholesale, then they would bypass retailers entirely.  Similarly, if many people had knowledge about how to start a business and knew several friendly venture capitalists or bank officers, many of them would start their own businesses and there would be few people to do the actual work.<p>Having said that, I think its important to emphasize some of the things that capitalism gets right: it is still a relatively open and distributed system that is able to evolve more freely than systems that are less so.  Open in that many people can actually apply for loans etc. and start their own businesses.  Distributed in that there are numerous options and usually no single point of failure.<p>I don't think that greed is necessarily fundamental to human nature.  That's an oversimplification.  Humans do need to compete sexually, but I don't think that extreme hierarchies are necessarily a requirement for that.  Much of what is considered human nature is just the current state of our culture.<p>I think its hard to create a system that operates consistently and soundly as a whole but at the same time is robust, distributed and free to develop in different directions.<p>However, I believe sure that we can improve our current situation by injecting a more egalitarian belief system as well as more science and technology into the power structure and its operating principles, which means the financial system.  For example, \"economics\" is now mainly gaming strategies for maintaining point (monetary) counts and the power that goes with them.  But because economics is so critical to human decision making, it must at some point incorporate human needs, social science, and physical science such as ecology.  There is a false belief that somehow these monetary gaming strategies and point/goods exchange systems (the economy) incorporate scientific knowledge, measurement, and technological knowledge automatically.  That is not the case currently.<p>One of the problems with all of the systems, capitalistic or anti-capitalistic, is the tendency to move, either quickly or more slowly, towards centralization.  When wealth/power as well as goods and services production concentrates it leads to vast inequality, poor distribution, stagnation, inability to cope with local conditions, etc.<p>I think we need to do a better job of centralizing information schemas and holistic knowledge but do that in a way that does not compromise the ability to evolve those knowledgebases and distribute production or lead towards centralization of power, etc.  Its not easy, but I think its a technological problem we can solve.", "time": 1346523135, "type": "comment"}

I take that description and spend a couple of days building a prototype web application.  I don't create the screens in Photoshop first because A) it will take longer and B) I'm not trying to create the ultimate user experience, I am trying to build functional software that we can start getting feedback and iterating on.<p>2. Analyst, customer, boss, designer, or someone who is not a programmer, looks at the prototype, may or may not acknowledge that the software now has the primary functionality requested, and starts criticizing the appearance or user experience.  Its actually easy for him to find flaws: its not very attractive (there was no time invested in making it attractive) and some use cases could involve fewer clicks.<p>2A. Here is the issue I have: it really seems to me that a significant portion of people believe at that point that the programmer was unable to conceive of an attractive design or shortcuts that would improve the user experience, and that is the context and justification for the entire field of design.<p>Anyway here is my experience: if you can't code, then you probably cannot actually create a better user experience than me.  If I am given time to work on a design, then I will optimize the user experience as much as possible given the features of the software platform and budget.

True that a lot of it is stupid or nonsense, but there is actually also a lot of useful and timely information in there.<p>I also remember using the Yahoo fantasy sports thing and it seemed pretty good to me.<p>And to be honest the Yahoo mail program is really attractive looking to me and very functional.<p>Yahoo Groups is extremely useful also.<p>I guess however its hard to compete with things like gmail, reddit and meetup.com.<p>So anyway since half of the comments in this thread are basically going on a 'pretend you are the new CEO of Yahoo, what would you do' thing, I want to play also.  Actually Yahoo has so much going on, its kind of hard to NOT want to play that game.<p>One thing to focus on making Yahoo Answers better. Maybe more ajaxy and realtime. Maybe make the app better (ask questions? voice input?). Maybe even do a deal with stackoverflow or something (although stackoverflow users might not appreciate that).<p>It seems like they have a ton of useful applications and other stuff.  I forgot one: Yahoo Games.  I guess the hard part is making money from all of those things.  I think to figure out what to do I would need to know how much each of those different parts of Yahoo cost to operate and how much money comes in (mostly from ads I assume).<p>I guess one big issue is the brand.  Ever since my old boss told me a few years back that Yahoo search was better, I associate Yahoo with idiots.  And even though I do think Yahoo Answers is very useful like I mentioned before, the large number of retarded Yahoo Answers questions doesn't help with that idiot brand image problem.<p>One random idea: its really expensive to build Android, iOS (especially), HTML5, Windows, OSX and Linux apps.  Especially if you want to target all of the above.  Maybe they could throw some money at Apple and Microsoft and make an application platform with WYSIWYG components, a little bit along the lines of Wordpress, but everything is a widget, and somehow make it work across all of those platforms, and built on Node.js (or something).  I say throw money at Microsoft and Apple because they are always (as far as I can tell) spending money on throwing up roadblocks to prevent good cross-platform solutions from becoming popular and practical.<p>One more random idea: I think the easiest way to compete as  internet giant these days might be to create products that cross into the 'real' world.  For example, the Google Project Glass project to me seems very exciting.  So are things like 3d print-on-demand.  Maybe Yahoo could build or promote a product/service along those lines?<p>Of course, those product/service ideas are extremely expensive, challenging and risky, so I dunno.<p>Other random idea: try to merge with one of the giant evil cable or media companies, such as Time Warner, if the government will let them.  Then maybe if the CEO and people are persuasive enough to the Time Warner execs with all of the Yahoo customer numbers (like 700 million visitors per month), we could finally get HBO GO without having to buy cable.  I mean I am not trying to make more gianter evil companies, but.. HBO GO without a cable subscription.<p>Other random idea: start converting to mainly telecommute by telling most people they can work from home and then eventually shutting down campuses.  Use that as a selling point for acquiring talent and also a way to save money.<p>OK last last random idea: find a way to defeat ad block.  Which would probably involve advertisements that actually weren't really advertisements somehow.  Maybe something like reddit, or reddit+twitter+facebook, a way for people to recommend/vote up/review/rate products/services or apps, possibly filtered based on the relevance of the current page.. then maybe you just charge all of the advertisers a small fee to be eligible and don't let any of them pay more, so its entirely driven by consumers rather than the amounts companies are willing to pay.<p>Anyway that was fun.", "time": 1343616696, "type": "comment"}

I see a parallel between the general derisive dismissal of Chomsky's academic views as being simplistic with the type of dismissal commonly given to a Chomskyish geopolitical viewpoint.

I think that the real cutting edge AI research is called AGI (artificial general intelligence) research.<p>The generation/category of AI research or machine learning that Norvig is tied into is much newer and steps beyond the earlier traditional AI that Chomsky might have been involved with, but the AGI researchers are a step beyond Norvig's clique.  And the AGI researchers are, by the way, very optimistic about the Singularity or at least the likelihood of human-like and probably super-human artificial general intelligence in the short or medium term.<p>I mean the Norvigish machine-learning stuff isn't completely disconnected from the AGI stuff and completely behind and I assume it will result in extremely capable AIs relatively soon, but the AGI approaches will probably prove to be more powerful and more humanlike since they are closer to human models.<p>Take a look at what Brain Corporation is doing, or Numenta, or the OpenCog project.

Not flirting with them, or hitting on them, or asking them out, or \"sexualizing\" them.  Just working with them.<p>First of all, I generally refrain from seeing women as holding the potential for interaction of any sort in any sort of setting.  Mostly because I generally don't interact with them, but also because I am bad at socializing in general and also because I have personal priorities to take care of before I am willing to attempt dating again.  I'm short, not particularly attractive, I have a health issue that causes me to feel and look fatigued a lot of the time, and I'm not particularly well-off financially.<p>So I get that.  No female in a working context ever wants to date _me_ or have any interaction with me outside of a professional one.  I got that many years ago.  Thanks for re-iterating that.<p>Anyway, I can understand that women are tired of being hit on at work.  They are just really really sick of it.  So I get the motivation for your comment.  But to suggest that, based on my comment, I was \"sexualizing\" women was not fair or accurate, and the reality is that some of the women who attend a hackathon would not mind one single bit if a man who was there who they felt was attractive flirted with them a small amount.<p>So I think that the truth is that not every woman in every circumstance in regards to every man at every event like that would agree that there is no potential for interaction outside of a professional setting whatsover with every man there.  Its worth emphasizing to keep things professional, but you definitely overstated things the way you worded your comment.<p>But anyway, don't worry.  If I ever attend such a hacker event with women (which I probably never will, realistically, I hardly leave my home, and I am really bad at making friends, even among hackers), I will never consider having any kind of friendly or otherwise social engagement or interaction with any of the women there aside from one that is 100% professional.

Yes, its nice to have a native look and feel or certain native features, but its not nice to have to make four different versions of the same application implemented in different platforms.  That just doesn't make sense.<p>The web as a platform seems to have obvious advantages, but there is some stuff missing that makes it fall short of native applications.  I think that doesn't have to be the case.<p>I think that 1) web browser teams have to work even harder to make the web as platform a reality, taking notice of a few particular problems, and 2) native application developers should stop being so enthusiastic about reinventing the wheel with multiple implementations.<p>As far as the problems that web browser teams need to be more aware of:<p>* HTML5 (mobile) applications need to install and launch just as easily as native applications.  The current efforts to enable this go just far enough to fool a lot of people into thinking that their HTML5 application is \"just like\" a native app, when it isn't.  They need an installer that is just as easy as mobile, a listing in an app store, and a launch button on a home page or app listing page.<p>* HTML5 (mobile) applications need to have the same API/device features available.<p>Maybe its just an impossible dream.  Maybe technology will never make sense or stop being so wasteful and re-inventy as long as it is being driven by people in this 'culture'.

I have suffered because of mistakes in the underlying platform implementation in some cases, but in my experience more often I am suffering because of fundamental design limitations of the platform.<p>People move on to the next thing because they know it solves fundamental engineering problems built in to the platform they are on that are causing constant problems and they are tired of suffering through that.  Such as manual memory management or traditional threading.<p>For example, back in my C/C++ days, I worked on a number of projects that were threaded and manually memory managed.  No matter how genius the team members were we always spent a significant amount of time either guarding against those types of issues or diagnosing them, or working on Make scripts or other build-related distractions.<p>So that was one reason why I moved to C#/.NET many years ago.  The advantage of being able to access source code in open source projects, cost benefit and lack of vendor lock in moved me away from that.<p>Or for example my main project right now is based on Etherpad which was originally written in Rhino which is a Java-based JavaScript.  They saved a lot of lines/characters of code by doing it in JavaScript originally which was good software engineering since less code means fewer defects and JavaScript runs on both the browser and server which is also helpful.  However, it was built on Java which has dated overly complicated APIs and Rhino is an inferior JavaScript engine.  And we can't get it to stop freezing up/crashing at random times, which according to one of the former Etherpad team members is normal.<p>So we are following the lead of Etherpad and converting the application to be based on Etherpad Lite which is a running on Node.js which is another next big thing.  There are no threads, so I know that can't cause any freezing.  The V8 memory management and code generation is state of the art.

Why would you learn C if you wanted to build interesting things?  I would learn C if I wanted to be the next Linus, but not for a whole lot of other reasons.<p>You need to be willing to put in the years of practice and able to find stuff that is easy to do but mildly interesting to experiment with.<p>If you want to make cool stuff, learn how to take advantage of other people's code.  For example, I am almost afraid to mention it on here, but there is this thing called .NET where they have controls you can drag onto a form that does lots of stuff without writing a lot of code.  If you learn how to use those types of things, you will be a better engineer.  The best engineers write less code and take advantage of all kinds of tools and widgets (that is not a popular idea, but its true.  ASCII source code is primitive).  There are also all kinds of 3d game engines and editors that give you a head start as far as making interesting stuff, for example Unity 3D or Unreal.<p>Maybe you could just install WordPress and start learning about all of the plugins.  Figure out how to configure WordPress to be like a site you think is worth copying.  Find an example plugin, copy it and then change it a little to do something slightly more interesting to you.  If you are able to use WordPress to implement a site or application that takes someone else twice as long to 'code by hand' or use some other CMS and it works just as well, then even though you didn't write as much code, you did a better job of engineering it.  Generally its better software engineering to reuse code that other people already wrote and tested.  It may not make you feel as 'elite', but its better software engineering (again, not everyone understands that, but its true).<p>Objective-C, I think besides being overly complicated and a bad starter language, I believe that entire thing is a big circlejerk and waste of everyone's time.  But if you are into circlejerks, there is lots of money to be made in that area.  So the way to do that is to find the best tutorial with complete code, follow it, copy all of the code, and start tweaking the app.<p>I recommend CoffeeScript for a language that makes sense.  Same general approach as above applies.  <a href=\"http://pcsedit.appspot.com/#edit/mbarkhau/example.coffee\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pcsedit.appspot.com/#edit/mbarkhau/example.coffee</a><p>Last thing, its normal to have lots of little problems to solve, things that are more or less trivial, because every single thing and every single character in your program needs to be perfect.  So no matter how many years you program or what level 'engineer' you are, you have to get used to being stuck on things.<p>The trick to being unstuck, depending on what you are stuck with, is 1) knowing how to use Google and copy or use what other people have done that already works and 2) in the case of debugging, having practice debugging.  Usually you want the best debugging tools available so you can see into the operation of your program step by step, but you really only have to have a way to output messages.<p>Software engineering is about feedback loops.  You can even look at object oriented design as a feedback loop.  Look at a chunk of code, if its hard to understand, break it into a smaller chunk.  If you start repeating nouns, make an object.  That sort of thing takes years of copying what other people are doing and studying and practicing before you are good at it.  But anyway for feedback, its between you and the code.  If you come back the next day and see large methods or code that is hard to understand, then you just gave yourself feedback about how you can refactor to make it simpler.<p>Or take test driven development and QA.  Again, its about feedback loops.  When you have a manual QA process or no QA process at all, you only find out that something is wrong or some code that you just changed affected some other code when (if) you are lucky enough to click on the right thing.  When you have a QA process, or if most methods in your codebase are tested automatically whenever something changes, you get a tighter feedback loop, i.e. you find out right away when something is wrong.<p>Or take part of the basic idea of 'agile' or 'lean'.  Again, about feedback loops, this time between you and the group you are producing software for.  The shorter the time or distance between your coding and users trying to use the system, the faster you can fix it to be just right.<p>Software engineering is not about writing the most code or the most advanced code or about writing code at all really if you can avoid it.  Take advantage of open source software, components, GUI tools etc. and get useful software into the hands of users, and you will stay motivated enough to expand your elite ASCII coding skills while at the same time doing software engineering.", "time": 1339913445, "type": "comment"}

But since we don't have that, I really would like something like a CloudFront.  Pretty much for every single application or web page that I make, I would actually like to have that.<p>Actually, I think it would be better if everyone and every web site had that, a way that sites could automatically be cached in servers local to everyone's city.  Wouldn't that be nice?<p>Which reminded me of the whole concept of content-centric networking.<p>Here is one related project that I found:  <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/haggle/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://code.google.com/p/haggle/</a><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-centric_networking\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-centric_networking</a><p>The hard part about this is that to really be effective it probably means really changing the way things work.  It is tough to ease into it.<p>This could also help with reducing the amount of data that needed to be transferred.  Maybe we could figure out a way so that every website in the world would be compressed referencing a very large global dictionary that was shared on every client (or possibly partitioned for local clusters, but that is more complicated..)<p>Regardless of the level of compression, it would still probably be possible to distribute quite a lot of the trending web content to be cached locally.  Maybe it could be a bit like a torrent client for people's desktops, or maybe web application servers could have an installed program that participates in the distribution system and also publishes to it.<p>Maybe it could be a browser extension or just userscript (Greasemonkey) (probably has to be an extension) that would cache and distribute web pages you view.  So for example as we are clicking on Hacker News headlines we are caching those pages on our local machines.  Then when another person who has the same script/extension installed clicks on that headline, it will first check his local peers, and if I am in the same city and have that file already, I can give him all of the content in a fraction of the time.  If a lot of people used that extension, the web would be much faster, and it would solve a lot of problems.<p>I wonder if there isn't already a system like that.  I mean there are probably RSS feeds that come off of Hacker News and Reddit, and a reader could actually precache all of that content.  But more comprehensively, I bet there is quite a bit of content that large numbers of say programmers are constantly accessing, that could benefit from that type of system.<p>Can we make something like a gzip but not limited to within 32kb or anything, instead it is a giant dictionary that is a GB in size with all of the most common sequences for all of the software engineering web sites that are popular today.

I learned that mostly from Jacque Fresco and Peter Joseph et al.  I disagree with their solution in that they are talking about a centralized control system, but most of Fresco's ideas I think are correct.  He just formed his theory before the research came out on how decentralized distributed systems are more robust.<p>So I don't think you can do away with money like the ZM people suggest, BUT you do need to be aware that there are quite a few important problems with the economic model, for instance the way that automation eliminates employment and therefore the consumer base.  Look up the Zeitgeist Movement/Venus Project and you can see all of the arguments.  Where I differ is in my solution.  I think its important to automate and move away from the consumer driven infinite growth ownership/labor model but I think that once we do that, rather than centralizing and homogenizing automated systems, we just need better information distribution, common data formats and exchange.  We need to have a more unified view of the real world and to be able to easily exchange information about it holistically.  But it is crucial at the same time to allow for diverse solutions to shared problems.  That is necessary to make the system robust, allow it to evolve, keep people sane, etc.<p>I think that representative government, if it was ever really supposed to be representative, has proven to be subservient to money.  Also governments have a monopoly on force.  I see governments as entrenching moneyed power and enabling its use of force against those with less money.  Essentially money is a point system that represents power.  I don't think we want to do away with the point system, at least its a way of keeping score.  However, we do need to change the nature of money and correct the fundamental problems with belief systems such as the Social Darwinistic viewpoint held by most people.  There is no group of truly superior individuals who deserve to have vastly more wealth and control than most people, or a large group of mostly worthless humans who don't really deserve to live.  However, I really believe that most people deep down believe both of those things.  Those beliefs support the current social framework, which as I said is antagonistic towards the application of technology, as well as creating massive inequality.<p>So \"economics\" needs to become a real science by first accepting a more up-to-date non-eugenicist model of humanity and its place in the universe as well as integrating physical and social science.  This will make it much easier to apply the scientific advances we already have to solving common human problems.  Humans need hierarchy of some sort as well as a way of keeping score and satisfying primate needs etc., but you have to integrate that with physical reality and common needs.", "time": 1335665283, "type": "comment"}

I also think that you will see more convenient on-screen navigation between apps and linking from app to app.<p>Ultimately because of their origins in the early static web, HTML5/CSS/JavaScript etc. are not the ideal platform for applications and so I think that directly coding that layer will fall out of fashion and instead it will become a base layer that other frameworks output.<p>I believe that the .NET-, Objective-C- and Java-based languages/platforms have dated core characteristics that make them disadvantageous as well as the problem of requiring extra coding.  So even if people aren't developing mobile apps on HTML5 or HTML5-based platforms they are likely to move towards using some other layer above the native based on the economics alone.<p>Its difficult to predict what will happen for sure though.  Personally, if I had my way, a lot of the current stack would be dropped immediately.  CSS would be first to go.  The concept of coding markup directly would be dropped.  Instead, interactive tools would be used for creating and maintaining UIs and other application structures.  Those tools would exchange data in the simplest possible common formats that could be agreed upon.  The common formats across tools would extend to include semantic descriptions of components above the implementation level.  ASCII source code would fall out of favor and be replaced with more interactive structural and semantic application editors.  HTTP, the web, and the traditional client-server would be dropped and replaced with content-oriented networking integrated with the common application and data exchange formats.  Browser-type applications/sites and desktop applications would converge so that web applications can integrate with the desktop environment.", "time": 1335233409, "type": "comment"}

I was too busy with other things to really get into it.  So since I had more experience (not a lot, but more) with Python than with Ruby, that is what CoffeeScript seems like to me, instead of Ruby.<p>I always liked Python syntax, its just that I was busy with projects that involved a lot of HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP etc.<p>I have spent years and years writing C#/C/C++/JavaScript/PHP code with curly braces etc.  To me, the curly braces and some other stuff are noise.  Especially when you get into callbacks and have to remember to keep all of your curly braces and parenthesis straight.  Its basically stuff that, as demonstrated by CoffeeScript, the compiler can take care of for you, but in JavaScript it just wasn't taken care of.<p>In a similar vein, JavaScript (and any other dynamic language or language with static type inference) demonstrates that type declarations aren't necessary, and that a language/compiler can usually take care of that stuff for you.<p>In a similar vein, C demonstrated (among other things) that managing the stack manually isn't necessary.<p>Ruby syntax to me is significantly more complicated than CoffeeScript and not really as clean (begin end blocks etc).  I think that Rails has some important advantages in terms of software engineering, but the performance and syntax of Ruby turns me off a bit.  Still, there is probably more good than bad so I might still end up doing some Rails stuff.<p>I don't think its advantageous to write an if statement backwards and I think people who wear black wire-rim glasses when they can easily afford contacts or don't even need lenses are ridiculous.

For awhile I felt like I did not want to learn CoffeeScript and that it was silly and annoying that people wanted me to waste time learning it.  Honestly what really started to change my mind was that I needed to alter PDFKit, and I had to learn a little bit of CoffeeScript in order to do that.  I think that the need to learn it came first and then later the rationalizations for why it was a good choice came after.<p>Another real issue that is below the surface but not mentioned while people are discussing the actual pros and cons of CoffeeScript: is JavaScript a good language, or is it fundamentally flawed somehow?<p>A professional JavaScript programmer's identity will often be tied in to some degree with his general JavaScript associations (the same way someone who races Formula 1 cars would identify with that type of car and might be offended if someone started attacking the body shape of those cars), and so to make a significant investment in learning CoffeeScript implies fundamental issues with JavaScript and may therefore be an attack on that person's identity.  Obviously this wouldn't be a conscious thought process but the subconscious associations are often there.<p>Whatever is making people choose to learn CoffeeScript or not to learn it, its not really a rational process usually.  Its more like a religious battle.<p>I think that the amount of time you have invested in JavaScript, how well you really know it, to what degree you have come to terms with/got over those pain points that CoffeeScript helps with, how much you identify with JavaScript versus other technologies, whether you actually have a specific need to learn CoffeeScript (i.e. for altering a library or reading a coworker's code), all of those things are going to add up subconsciously in a sort of vector for or against CoffeeScript that is pretty much an emotion which will motivate different rationalizations about specifics.<p>So in cases where that subconscious equation just isn't adding up in CoffeeScript's favor people will find all sorts of (often tangential) arguments against it.  One thing that probably can help if you are trying to push CoffeeScript is to repeatedly mention certain small improvements such as using -&#62; instead of writing function() or the class and extends syntax.  That would mean that they would have to learn those things just in the process of the discussion.

I think its sort like what happens quite often between a manager and his employees: the manager makes some proclamations that are impractical and often unrealistic, and some significant portion of the employees decide they just have to smile and nod, but basically they are ignoring it as invalid.  So in this case they feel they are forced to falsify the results.<p>I think that probably there are some schools in well-off neighborhoods where kids are advantaged and the administrators don't run into these issues that they consider moral dilemmas.  The administrators and teachers in those schools may say that the other teachers deserved to be fired based on the poor performance of their students, but those privileged teachers aren't aware of the disadvantages that the other students are working against and therefore don't realize that students' failure to meet objectives often isn't their teacher's fault.<p>Personally I think that national measurements and guidelines are very important, but fine-grained command centralized control over an entire system has been proven time and again to be repressive and result in failure.<p>This goes for all sorts of systems, not just education.

I think this is false.<p>He also assumes that Googling won't be the first thing junior developers do when they are given an unfamiliar task.  Unfortunately, for too many, this is the case.  The solution to that problem is to train junior developers to google.  It sounds like the author of this article also has yet to learn the importance of googling first.<p>A lot of these problems are actually not new and are like the example of the picture.  If you google 'how to hang a picture' you will find good explanations.  You are unlikely to find a lot of people at the top of the search results who are telling you to cut the drywall.<p>When it comes down to SAX versus DOM, that's not really quite comparable to hanging a picture.  In those types of cases, what you say to the junior developer is 'Google it and come back to me when you've found some example code that you are going to start with'.  That way you can guide them if necessary before they get too far in.  Or give them a starting direction, being as explicit as possible (point to code example).<p>If they are googling and coming back with really strange solutions (which, again, you tell them to go over the outline of the solution with you before they start implementing it), then maybe they don't have the intellectual capacity or experience for the tasks you are giving them.<p>On the second half of this post, he is also wrong.  The timid and tentative developers will probably often get along fine with the more senior developers, because they are going to be happy to do things exactly the way they tell them and won't talk back.  Part of the time they will be so clueless that they can't get anything done, and since they don't use Google they won't get anywhere but the others will be careful to follow the lead of the senior developers.  So the traditional approaches will be passed on and everyone will be happy.<p>Anyway in the end he more or less gets to his conclusion which is reasonable enough, although stated in a way which I find to be somewhat arrogant.  I think the entire basis for this was a fair amount of wasted time which was at least partly the fault of the more senior developer not providing initial guidance or checking in on the junior developer.<p>It IS definitely helpful when developers, whatever their experience level, are secure and modest enough to ask for other people's knowledge, opinions and help freely.  I have found this to be rare.  Too often asking questions is simply interpreted quite stupidly to mean that the other developer is ignorant.  And also quite stupidly, not know literally everything is interpreted as ignorance.<p>To boil it down, the author sounds like a dick, should take some responsibility for the wasted development effort that he is trying to put all on the junior developer, should learn to Google himself, read my post, learn to ask questions himself, and work very hard at cloaking his arrogance when he speaks to the junior developer.  And no I do not know who this person is and am not actually related to the situation.  Article just pushes some of my buttons.", "time": 1332400619, "type": "comment"}

Unfortunately, something very similar happens in collectivism: power and resources are still aggregated in the hands of a few.<p>In other words, both systems tend towards centralization.  Theoretically, the collectivists will aim for redistributing power and resources for the good of the many, but there are a couple of practical problems: they are still living in hierarchical societies and so have strong motivation for enriching themselves and the controllers cannot see enough detail to know what is really best for the rest of society.<p>Command economies don't work because of general problems with centralization and lack of distribution and the limitations of the types of technologies employed.  A peer-to-peer network is more robust than an internet with only a few backbones.<p>Unfortunately, capitalists don't realize that their system also leads to monopoly and centralization.<p>I believe that we do need wholistic measurement and analysis of things like global resources and human equality, and a common principle of supporting the collective good.  But at the same time we need to decentralize and distribute production locally.  We need local decision making that operates on the basis of a global information schema with wholistic data.<p>A system can't be efficient or evolve without being localized, but it also can't be integrated without an accurate shared knowledgebase and an egalitarian perspective.", "time": 1331424454, "type": "comment"}

Rather than having land directly granted to the lords by the King, banks provide loans to those who can demonstrate a history of ownership (a parallel to the authentication of nobility).  Rather than working the land directly for subsistence, workers are required to exchange wages for money to pay for food and the right to stay in their homes.<p>A worker who does not please his boss or the ownership will be fired and no longer receive wages.  Because of urbanization, few people have the land, skills or other requirements for producing their own food, and must purchase food with money earned through wages.

B is the real issue: something like SOAP was necessary to make RPC possible over the web for typed languages like C# and Java.<p>REST was a counterargument made by some people coming from a dynamic languages standpoint who really didn't need as much information as the statically typed language people.  Its too bad that people have taken A so seriously though and gotten confused or misled (probably deliberately) about  what SOAP was for and then tried to make REST into that.<p>The most convenient and useful API, even over the web, is one that is as close to normal programming as possible.  In other words, RPC-style (or some improvement on that like NowJS).  That doesn't mean that you can or should forget that you are making remote calls, it just means that you have less other unrelated plumbing to think about.<p>If you want to do RPC in a dynamic language over the web, NowJS is your model.  The problem is that dynamic languages and statically typed languages have different requirements.  I don't think that either SOAP or REST are a good solution to making the two styles work together on a web RPC.  I think we need to work on that more.<p>I guess one more thing complicating this is the fact that most APIs (just like most software systems in general) are in fact dealing with the standard create, read, update, delete operations on data, with some variations.  Batch updates are the most common variation, which you could actually easily extend the CRUD model for.  The thing is, you almost always have important deviations from that where the CRUD model doesn't fit.  But regardless of whether you are doing CRUD or something else, you still want your API to be as simple and normal as possible and that means RPC.<p>Maybe as some point we can focus more on languages or frameworks that better integrate the CRUD concept and things like calculated fields and aggregation, and transparently handle tasks like persistence and shared state.<p>Just about all of the programs I write need to persist their data and transmit/share their state.  Maybe we want a semantic data oriented networking programming system (or more of them).  This would be inspired by dynamic languages like JavaScript but necessarily incorporate some kind of typing more integrally (inferred?).<p>Maybe just start with NowJS, bake in some kind of CRUD generation based on nested schema definitions, put that on the server, add a way to indicate that operations need to be batched (for transactional consistency and practical network performance) and make the nice MongoDB criteria and now aggregation stuff baked into the client-side also.

And that part can be an improvement.<p>However, quite a few people seem to think that means you can fit that many more features in, which is false.<p>This is the big challenge for agile in my opinion: automated testing or even testing at all, is hard for many development teams for a number of reasons.  Not to say that the actual skills or knowledge are particularly difficult to acquire.  But practically speaking, putting into place a good testing and release system are challenging for many teams.<p>And doing \"agile\" (read: code and release more features faster) without solid automated testing or at least one real QA analyst who is busy, will guarantee that you have a ton of regressions and broken deployments.  Now, since you are releasing much more often, you will still gain from getting much more feedback from customers, but there will be loud drone of bug fixing conflicting with the \"agile\" manager's push to release more features.<p>If your implementation of \"agile\" actually includes frequent refactoring and you don't have unit or at least integration tests, you are definitely going to be sorry.<p>Test-driven development requires a little bit more discipline, sometimes more up-front design, and sometimes investment in developer training.  If TDD or the like is off the table or only partially implemented but you are still going ahead with \"agile\", then you still might survive, if you have a real QA analyst and solid process.  My perception and experience is that most managers will decide that hiring an additional person \"just for testing\" is \"not in the budget\" and if they do bring someone onto the project for QA they will think they can use just any person rather than hiring a single QA professional.<p>That has been my experience with agile.  Several years in, I am still working on trying to discipline myself and with my latest project I am having a bit of success with vows-bdd integration tests.

The thing is, it seems quite far-fetched to think that someone would give me 18 months worth of cash to make my vision a reality. Anyway, here is the idea: <a href=\"http://cure.willsave.me/vision\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cure.willsave.me/vision</a> . Basically the goal is to replace WordPress with a platform that has a number of advantages, starting with a CoffeeScript codebase running on Node.js.<p>\"The Cure Platform is a component- and plugin- based content and data management framework.<p>The main goal for this platform is increased developer and user productivity. To achieve that the platform will have these features:<p>* WYSIWYG drag-and-drop designer. No source code templates (no mixed markup/source) and limited CSS.<p>* Component (GUI control) -based architecture to enable easier code reuse and faster configuration and integration of modules.<p>* Comprehensive data framework enabling drag-and-drop form creation with corresponding updates to hierarchical models. Transparent data handling.  \"<p>So my plan is, while I am finishing up my current project, to work on this new platform.  I have already started with some of the implementation.  I would very much like to avoid getting another \"regular job\" or gig when my main project is complete, and so I was hoping against hope that somehow I could crank out a simplified version of this new platform and miraculously turn that into my day job immediately.  Or perhaps get a few thousand dollars from kickstarter.com or some such.. but most likely not try to raise much money at all, and probably not do any fundifying until I had a prototype of some sort.<p>Anyway, supposing I can live on just $3,000 per month, and I need exactly 1 person to help me who also only needs $3,000 per month.  Suppose that includes all of our expenses for servers etc. and we are working out of our homes.  3000 * 18 = 54000 * 2 = $108,000.<p>I'm sure people will tell me I am wrongheaded, doing something wrong, or misinterpreting, but I think that this article is quite clearly saying I should try to get $108,000.  This seems completely unrealistic to start going around trying to get $108,000.  And actually, once I have a prototype, I still doubt I will even want that much money -- I will probably be happy to try to sell the system for 2 or 3 months, so maybe 3 months would be nice, but after that, I can't see going 5 or 6 months spending someone else's money without significant money coming in, so the $108,000 doesn't even seem prudent.<p>Anyway, if someone reading this wants to give me $108,000, I am sure I can build the system I described.. just not sure if people would be smart enough to adopt it.

Its  really got the abstraction thing and taking into consideration crazy things like developments in software engineering practices and programming languages.<p>Having said that, I don't really know much about Rails.  This comment is not about Rails.  I just have to tell people because I keep thinking about something and almost no one seems to get it and realistically I am probably never going to follow through with it so if I can't communicate this idea it might not go anywhere.  And with all of the positive progressive things Rails developers are doing, maybe, just maybe someone reading this will get what I am talking about.<p>Basically, I keep thinking, especially just now when I was looking at that Rails code in his slides, the way everything is so well abstracted and so _structured_, and how he keeps going to the model with the circles connecting, and how we keep repeating keywords all over the place, and how no one ever wants to look at unsyntaxhighlighted code anymore, I have to say _again_, one-dimensional non-interactive (or two dimensional if you insist on calling it that) textual representations of software are outdated and unnecessary now.<p>Sure, we do still have to type a lot of text in, and I am not trying to throw out my keyboard, or stop thinking or something.  But there just really isn't any reason we have to be limited to text on a daily basis anymore.  People just have a cognitive bias towards the status quo which is preventing them from taking the step to add a layer of two-dimensional widgets or something over the code.  I am talking about code generating widgets, or intentional software, or a generic interactive graphical representation for function calls, control flow, model development.  Things like that.<p>Because basically a lot of code, even the things that involve a lot of abstractions with embedded textual mini-languages in them, are mostly mapping from one thing to another.  Doing transformations on structures.  Code-completion is a start, but what we really want are more useful iteractions with the models and algorithms.  The way forward is things like code generation, projectional editing, live coding, dynamic evaluation and representation (widgets) etc.  Anything that provides more interactivity to the software development process is where we should be going.<p>And the next big step is to get out of the limitation of using textual code as the default editing level.  Often times we are basically configuring/connecting functions/components, editing models, or using text to generate two dimensional features like tables/grids, UI forms, sometimes mathematical functions, or dynamic systems that we really need to interact with at runtime with dynamic graphical editors to manipulate and comprehend properly.  So we should start on the two-dimensional, graphical level.  Also, downloading open source projects whose claim to fame is completeness and ease of integration and then reading documentation which amounts to what commands to enter on the command line and then cutting and pasting and editing configuration text files in terminal windows is not cutting it anymore.  There are these things called (graphical?) components.  We can accomplish this with things like projectional editors, or even more simply by interacting with widgets that generate code.  And yes, I know what LabView is, and no, that tool and other attempts at visual programming systems haven't proven anything.  Its just hard to get these types of tools to be as generic as text-only systems, especially fully integrating keyboard and text use, AND, the number one hindrance, I believe, is status quo bias like loss aversion.", "time": 1259979949, "type": "comment"}

Indeed, depending on additional labels (class or continuous value) which can be used (or available) on none of the patterns, on a subset of the patterns or on all of them, unsupervised or supervised learning can be sequentially performed. When there is no prior knowledge on the problem to be solved, knowledge extraction may use an unsupervised neural network as a front-end for forecasting applications or extracting rules. Because of its synthesis capabilities, an unsupervised neural network can be used both for limiting the computation complexity and for extracting the most significant knowledge. Moreover, knowledge extraction is facilitated as soon as multi-viewpoint unsupervised neural network model is used. This kind of methods also allows using in a second step additional information when it is available for optimizing a forecasting problem. However, for a forecasting problem where all patterns are labelled, classical networks using supervised learning can be successfully improved by finding the minimal architecture using pruning algorithms. The pruning methods consist in removing, during learning, the connections or neurons, or both, that have the least influence on the system's performance. Reducing the complexity of the networks prevents overtraining and allows easier implementation and knowledge extraction (variable selection, rule extraction). In any case, combining several models into a committee helps to improve the quality of the knowledge extracted or the forecasting and the proposed methods must be efficient for typical real-world in our domain, dealing with large amount of noisy and temporal data. Both topics are recently developed in the project.<p>I actually think that, in OpenCog, for example, reasoning or other systems could take advantage of a SNN to provide rule selection or knowledge extraction, etc.<p>So the point is that even though they might be completely ignoring most higher-level necessary aspects of human cognition, a more comprehensive system can still benefit from incorporating SNNs.", "time": 1238032828, "type": "comment"}
